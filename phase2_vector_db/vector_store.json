Professional Management \u2014 Investors may not have the time or the required knowledge and resources to conduct their research and purchase individual stocks or bonds. A mutual fund is managed by full-time, professional money managers who have the expertise, experience and resources to actively buy, sell, and monitor investments. A fund manager continuously monitors investments and rebalances the portfolio accordingly to meet the scheme\u2019s objectives. Portfolio management by professional fund managers is one of the most important advantages of a mutual fund.2. Risk Diversification \u2014 Buying shares in a mutual fund is an easy way to diversify your investments across many securities and asset categories such as equity, debt and gold, which helps in spreading the risk - so you won't have all your eggs in one basket. This proves to be beneficial when an underlying security of a given mutual fund scheme experiences market headwinds. With diversification, the risk associated with one asset class is countered by the others. Even if one investment in the portfolio decreases in value, other investments may not be impacted and may even increase in value. In other words, you don\u2019t lose out on the entire value of your investment if a particular component of your portfolio goes through a turbulent period. Thus, risk diversification is one of the most prominent advantages of investing in mutual funds.3. Affordability & Convenience (Invest Small Amounts) \u2014 For many investors, it could be more costly to directly purchase all of the individual securities held by a single mutual fund. By contrast, the minimum initial investments for most mutual funds are more affordable.4. Liquidity \u2014 You can easily redeem (liquidate) units of open ended mutual fund schemes to meet your financial needs on any business day (when the stock markets and/or banks are open), so you have easy access to your money. Upon redemption, the redemption amount is credited in your bank account within one day to 3-4 days, depending upon the type of scheme e.g., in respect of Liquid Funds and Overnight Funds, the redemption amount is paid out the next business day.However, please note that units of close-ended mutual fund schemes can be redeemed only on maturity. Likewise, units of ELSS have a 3-year lock-in period and can be liquidated only thereafter.5. Low Cost \u2014 An important advantage of mutual",

Likewise, units of ELSS have a 3-year lock-in period and can be liquidated only thereafter.5. Low Cost \u2014 An important advantage of mutual funds is their low cost. Due to huge economies of scale, mutual funds schemes have a low expense ratio. Expense ratio represents the annual fund operating expenses of a scheme, expressed as a percentage of the fund\u2019s daily net assets. Operating expenses of a scheme are administration, management, advertising related expenses, etc. The limits of expense ratio for various types of schemes has been specified under Regulation 52 of SEBI Mutual Fund Regulations, 1996.6. Well-Regulated \u2014 Mutual Funds are regulated by the capital markets regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) under SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. SEBI has laid down stringent rules and regulations keeping investor protection, transparency with appropriate risk mitigation framework and fair valuation principles.7. Tax Benefits \u2014Investment in ELSS upto \u20b91,50,000 qualifies for tax benefit under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Mutual Fund investments when held for a longer term are tax efficient.Hide MenuRelated TopicsMyths & Facts About Mutual FundsHow to invest in Mutual FundsTax Regime for Mutual FundsAssociation of Mutual Funds in IndiaCIN- U65991MH1995NPL092062Know About AMFIAbout AMFIObjectivesBoard of DirectorsAMFI ExecutivesCommitteesView MoreMediaPress ReleaseAMFI PublicationsAMFI Mutual Fund SummitGalleryVideosOther LinksSchedule of Investor Awareness ProgramAMC BranchesLocate a MF DistributorSEBIUseful LinksView MoreTERMS OF USE|PRIVACY NOTICE\u00a9 2025 AMFI.

Equity funds may focus on certain sectors of the market or may have a specific investment style, such as investing in value or growth stocks.Equity Fund Categories as per SEBI guidelines on Categorization and Rationalization of schemesSector Specific FundsSectoral funds invest in a particular sector of the economy such as infrastructure, banking, technology or pharmaceuticals etc.\u2013 Since these funds focus on just one sector of the economy, they limit diversification, and are thus riskier.\u2013 Timing of investment into such funds are important, because the performance of the sectors tend to be cyclical.Examples of Sector Specific Funds - Equity Mutual Funds with an investment objective to invest inPharma & Healthcare SectorBanking & Finance Sector:FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) and related sectors.Technology and related sectorsThematic fundsThematic funds select stocks of companies in industries that belong to a particular theme - For example, Infrastructure, Service industries, PSUs or MNCs.They are more diversified than Sectoral Funds and hence have lower risk than Sectoral funds.Value Funds (Strategy and Style Based Funds)Equity funds may be categorized based on the valuation parameters adopted in stock selection, such as\u2013 Growth funds identify momentum stocks that are expected to perform better than the market\u2013 Value funds identify stocks that are currently undervalued but are expected to perform well over time as the value is unlockedEquity funds may hold a concentrated portfolio to benefit from stock selection.\u2013 These funds will have a higher risk since the",

The tenor is increased if interest rates are expected to go down and vice versaFloating rate funds invest in bonds whose interest are reset periodically so that the fund earns coupon income that is in line with current rates in the market, and eliminates interest rate risk to a large extentShort-Term Debt FundsThe primary focus of short-term debt funds is coupon income. Short term debt funds have to also be evaluated for the credit risk they may take to earn higher coupon income. The tenor of the securities will define the return and risk of the fund.\u2013 Funds holding securities with lower tenors have lower risk and lower return.Liquid funds invest in securities with not more than 91 days to maturity.Ultra Short-Term Debt Funds hold a portfolio with a slightly higher tenor to earn higher coupon income.Short-Term Fund combine coupon income earned from a pre-dominantly short-term debt portfolio with some exposure to longer term securities to benefit from appreciation in price.Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) -FMPs are closed-ended funds which eliminate interest rate risk and lock-in a yield by investing only in securities whose maturity matches the maturity of the fund.\u2013 FMPs create an investment portfolio whose maturity profile match that of the FMP tenor.\u2013 Potential to provide better returns than liquid funds and Ultra Short Term Funds since investments are locked in\u2013 Low mark to market risk as investments are liquidated at maturity.\u2013 Investors commit money for a fixed period.\u2013 Investors cannot prematurely redeem the units from the fund\u2013 FMPs, being closed-end schemes are mandatorily listed - investors can buy or sell units of FMPs only on the stock exchange after the NFO.\u2013 Only Units held in dematerialized mode can be traded; therefore investors seeking liquidity in such schemes need to have a demat accounCapital Protection Oriented FundsCapital Protection Oriented Funds are close-ended hybrid funds that create a portfolio of debt instruments and equity derivatives\u2013 The portfolio is structured to provide capital protection and is rated by a credit rating agency on its ability to do so. The rating is reviewed every quarter.\u2013 The debt component of the portfolio has to be invested in instruments with the highest investment grade rating.\u2013 A portion of the amount brought in by the investors is invested in debt instruments that is expected to mature to the par value of the capital invested",

The capital is thus protected.\u2013 The remaining portion of the funds is used to invest in equity derivatives to generate higher returnsHybrid fundsHybrid funds Invest in a mix of equities and debt securities.SEBI has classified Hybrid funds into 7 sub-categories as follows:Solution-oriented & Other fundsHybrid fundsInvest in a mix of equities and debt securities. They seek to find a \u2018balance\u2019 between growth and income by investing in both equity and debt.\u2013 The regular income earned from the debt instruments provide greater stability to the returns from such funds.\u2013 The proportion of equity and debt that will be held in the portfolio is indicated in the Scheme Information Document\u2013 Equity oriented hybrid funds (Aggressive Hybrid Funds) are ideal for investors looking for growth in their investment with some stability.\u2013 Debt-oriented hybrid funds (Conservative Hybrid Fund) are suitable for conservative investors looking for a boost in returns with a small exposure to equity.\u2013 The risk and return of the fund will depend upon the equity exposure taken by the portfolio - Higher the allocation to equity, greater is the riskMulti Asset FundsA multi-asset fund offers exposure to a broad number of asset classes, often offering a level of diversification typically associated with institutional investing.Multi-asset funds may invest in a number of traditional equity and fixed income strategies, index-tracking funds, financial derivatives as well as commodity like gold.This diversity allows portfolio managers to potentially balance risk with reward and deliver steady, long-term returns for investors, particularly in volatile markets.Arbitrage Funds\u201cArbitrage\u201d is the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset to take advantage of the price differential in the two markets and profit from price difference of the asset on different markets or in different forms.\u2013 Arbitrage fund buys a stock in the cash market and simultaneously sells it in the Futures market at a higher price to generate returns from the difference in the price of the security in the two markets.\u2013 The fund takes equal but opposite positions in both the markets, thereby locking in the difference.\u2013 The positions have to be held until expiry of the",

Thus it delivers risk-free profit for the investor/trader.\u2013 Price movements do not affect initial price differential because the profit in one market is set-off by the loss in the other market.\u2013 Since mutual funds invest own funds, the difference is fully the return.Hence, Arbitrage funds are considered to be a good choice for cautious investors who want to benefit from a volatile market without taking on too much risk.Index FundsIndex funds create a portfolio that mirrors a market index.\u2013 The securities included in the portfolio and their weights are the same as that in the index\u2013 The fund manager does not rebalance the portfolio based on their view of the market or sector\u2013 Index funds are passively managed, which means that the fund manager makes only minor, periodic adjustments to keep the fund in line with its index. Hence, Index fund offers the same return and risk represented by the index it tracks.\u2013 The fees that an index fund can charge is capped at 1.5%Investors have the comfort of knowing the stocks that will form part of the portfolio, since the composition of the index is known.Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)An ETF is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund.ETFs are listed on stock exchanges.Unlike regular mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange. The traded price of an ETF changes throughout the day like any other stock, as it is bought and sold on the stock exchange.ETF Units are compulsorily held in Demat modeETFs are passively managed, which means that the fund manager makes only minor, periodic adjustments to keep the fund in line with its indexBecause an ETF tracks an index without trying to outperform it, it incurs lower administrative costs than actively managed portfolios.Rather than investing in an \u2018active\u2019 fund managed by a fund manager, when one",

The daily NAV of a mutual fund is disclosed after deducting the expenses.Currently, in India, the expense ratio is fungible, i.e., there is no limit on any particular type of allowed expense as long as the total expense ratio is within the prescribed limit. The regulatory limits of TER that can be incurred/charged to the fund by a Mutual Fund AMC have been specified under Regulation 52 of SEBI Mutual Fund Regulations.Effective from April 1, 2020 the TER limit has been revised as follows.In addition, mutual funds have been allowed to charge up to 30 bps more, if the new inflows from retail investors from beyond top 30 cities (B30) cities are at least (a) 30% of gross new inflows in the scheme or (b) 15% of the average assets under management (year to date) of the scheme, whichever is higher. This is essentially to encourage inflows into mutual funds from tier - 2 and tier - 3 cities.TER has a direct bearing on a scheme\u2019s NAV \u2013 the lower the expense ratio of a scheme, the higher the NAV. Thus, TER is an important parameter while selecting a mutual fund scheme.As per the current SEBI Regulations, mutual funds are required to disclose the TER of all schemes on a daily basis on their websites as well as AMFI\u2019s website.Hide MenuRelated TopicsNet Asset ValueTrack your MF Investments using Fund Fact SheetDownload Various FormsAssociation of Mutual Funds in IndiaCIN- U65991MH1995NPL092062Know About AMFIAbout AMFIObjectivesBoard of DirectorsAMFI ExecutivesCommitteesView MoreMediaPress ReleaseAMFI PublicationsAMFI Mutual Fund SummitGalleryVideosOther LinksSchedule of Investor Awareness ProgramAMC BranchesLocate a MF DistributorSEBIUseful LinksView MoreTERMS OF USE|PRIVACY NOTICE\u00a9 2025 AMFI.

The income / gains generated from this collective investment scheme are distributed proportionately amongst the investors, after deducting applicable expenses and levies, by calculating a scheme's \"Net Asset Value\" or NAV. In return, mutual fund charges a small fee.In short, mutual fund is a collective pool of money contributed by several investors and managed by a professional Fund Manager.Mutual Funds in India are established in the form of a Trust under Indian Trust Act, 1882, in accordance with SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.The fees and expenses charged by the mutual funds to manage a scheme are regulated and are subject to the limits specified by SEBI.HOW A MUTUAL FUND WORKS?One should avoid the temptation to review the fund's performance each time the market falls or jumps up significantly. For an actively-managed equity scheme, one must have patience and allow reasonable time - between 18 and 24 months - for the fund to generate returns in the portfolio.When you invest in a mutual fund, you are pooling your money with many other investors. Mutual fund issues \"Units\" against the amount invested at the prevailing NAV. Returns from a mutual fund may include income distributions to investors out of dividends, interest, capital gains or other income earned by the mutual fund. You can also have capital gains (or losses) if you sell the mutual fund units for more (or less) than the amount you invested.Mutual funds are ideal for investors who \u2013lack the knowledge or skill / experience of investing in stock markets directly.want to grow their wealth, but do not have the inclination or time to research the stock market.wish to invest only small amount.WHY INVEST IN MUTUAL FUNDS?As investment goals vary from person to person \u2013 post-retirement expenses, money for children's education or marriage, house purchase, etc. \u2013 the investment products required to achieve these goals too vary.

The units are issued at the time of the initial offer and redeemed only on maturity. The units of close-ended schemes are mandatorily listed to provide exit route before maturity and can be sold/traded on the stock exchanges.\u2022 Interval schemes allow purchase and redemption during specified transaction periods (intervals). The transaction period has to be for a minimum of 2 days and there should be at least a 15-day gap between two transaction periods. The units of interval schemes are also mandatorily listed on the stock exchanges.Scheme Classification by Portfolio ManagementActive FundsIn an Active Fund, the Fund Manager is \u2018Active\u2019 in deciding whether to Buy, Hold, or Sell the underlying securities and in stock selection. Active funds adopt different strategies and styles to create and manage the portfolio.The investment strategy and style are described upfront in the Scheme Information document (offer document)Active funds expect to generate better returns (alpha) than the benchmark index.The risk and return in the fund will depend upon the strategy adopted.Active funds implement strategies to \u2018select\u2019 the stocks for the portfolio.Passive FundsPassive Funds hold a portfolio that replicates a stated Index or Benchmark e.g. \u2013Index FundsExchange Traded Funds (ETFs)In a Passive Fund, the fund manager has a passive role, as the stock selection / Buy, Hold, Sell decision is driven by the Benchmark Index and the fund manager / dealer merely needs to replicate the same with minimal tracking error.Active v/s Passive FundsActive Fund \u2013Rely on professional fund managers who manage investments.Aim to outperform Benchmark IndexSuited for investors who wish to take advantage of fund managers' alpha generation potential.Passive Funds \u2013Investment holdings mirror and closely track a benchmark index, e.g., Index Funds or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)Suited for investors who want to",

However, returns from Growth funds tend to be volatile over the short-term since the prices of the underlying equity shares may change.Hence investors must be able to take volatility in the returns in the short-term.Income fundsThe objective of Income Funds is to provide regular and steady income to investors.Income funds invest in fixed income securities such as Corporate Bonds, Debentures and Government securities.The fund\u2019s return is from the interest income earned on these investments as well as capital gains from any change in the value of the securities.The fund will distribute the income provided the portfolio generates the required returns. There is no guarantee of income.The returns will depend upon the tenor and credit quality of the securities held.Liquid / Overnight /Money Market Mutual FundsLiquid Schemes, Overnight Funds and Money market mutual fund are investment options for investors seeking liquidity and principal protection, with commensurate returns.\u2013 The funds invest in money market instruments* with maturities not exceeding 91 days.\u2013 The return from the funds will depend upon the short-term interest rate prevalent in the market.These are ideal for investors who wish to park their surplus funds for short periods.\u2013 Investors who use these funds for longer holding periods may be sacrificing better returns possible from products suitable for a longer holding period.* Money Market Instruments includes commercial papers, commercial bills, treasury bills, Government securities having an unexpired maturity up to one year, call or notice money, certificate of deposit, usance bills, and any other like",

    "b) enjoy distinct competitive advantages, and c) have superior financial strength. The aim of the equity strategy will be to build a portfolio, representing a cross section of companies diversified across major industries, economic sectors and market capitalization that offer an acceptable risk reward balance. A part of the funds may be invested in debt and money market instruments. Investment in Debt securities (including securitised debt) and Money Market Instruments will be as per the limits in the asset allocation table of the Scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI (MF) Regulations. Investment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their outlook. The Scheme may also invest in the hybrid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for diversification and subject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time. Subject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may engage in Stock Lending activities. The Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF) Regulations. As part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as futures and options, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible in future under applicable regulations. However, trading in deriva tives by the Scheme shall be for restricted purposes as permitted by the regulations. For detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI. For exposure limits to derivatives, refer section \u2018Where will the scheme invest\u2019 under Section II, Part II, Clause A in the SID. Though every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the AMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved. No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme. 8. Risk Profile of the Scheme Mutual Fund Units involve investment risks including the possible loss of principal. Please read the details on risk factors carefully before investment. Scheme specific Risk Factors are summarized below: (i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments \u25cf Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks. 6 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM \u25cf Securities, which are not quoted on",
    "to price fluctuations on a daily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks. 6 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM \u25cf Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to secur ities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk. \u25cf While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u25cf Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances. (ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities \u2022 The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates. \u2022 Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u2022 Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of the issuers. \u2022 Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligati ons) or any other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all o f which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis. \u2022",
    "or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all o f which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis. \u2022 Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme. \u2022 Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income fr om reinvestment is the \"interest on interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed. \u2022 Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settl ement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in the Scheme's portfolio. \u2022 Government securities where a fixed r eturn is offered run price -risk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a 7 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM function of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price -risk is not",
    "days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price -risk is not unique to Government Securities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the sense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are infl uenced only by movement in interest rates in the financial system. \u2022 Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme ris k may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated bonds. \u2022 The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio. \u2022 As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic paymen t of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the time remaining until maturity or the date w hen securities begin paying current interest. It also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically. (iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: Except for any security of an associate or group",
    "liquidity of the security and the perceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically. (iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: Except for any security of an associate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a stock exchange (\u201cunlisted Securities\u201d) which in general are subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value. \u2022 Investment in unrated instruments m ay involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer -specific developments. Such investments display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities. (iv) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated securities The risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to the risk factors associated with debt instruments. 8 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM \u2022 Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and could include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter of comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity could be either related or non -related to the issuer like a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of the credit e nhancement provider, as well as the issuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan pools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer. \u2022 Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit enhancements.",
    "as well as the issuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan pools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer. \u2022 Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit enhancements. Debt securities lack a well -developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold. \u2022 Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, apart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit risk. (v) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri -party Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments. T he members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL). As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization",
    "waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL). As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's contribution if th ere is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non -defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement ob ligations. In addition, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member). CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades 9 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM and the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contri bution to the default fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund. (vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities \u25cf Currency Risk: Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated i n foreign currencies, the Indian Rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co -related, can differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to their interest rate cycles. \u25cf Credit Risk: Investment in Foreign De bt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations",
    "to their interest rate cycles. \u25cf Credit Risk: Investment in Foreign De bt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with rating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency. \u25cf Taxation Risk: In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI) under section \u201cSpecial Consideration\u201d, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges based on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation. The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its investment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing / evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries wh ere the Scheme invests. All these may entail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk: Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject could differ materially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively. \u25cf Country Risk: The Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include 10 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM events such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi - lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of trades or otherwise. \u25cf To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions",
    "immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of trades or otherwise. \u25cf To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time. \u2022 Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities: In case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by regulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in permissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity. (vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives \u25cf The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative prod ucts, from time to time, in an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with stock s and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices. \u25cf Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies. \u25cf The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. \u25cf Credit Risk: The credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. \u25cf Market Risk: Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. \u25cf Illiquidity risk: This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of",
    "there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. \u25cf Market Risk: Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. \u25cf Illiquidity risk: This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of liquidity in the market. Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging u sing Interest Rate Futures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. (viii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares 11 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM \u25cf Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non - cumulative preference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on pr eference shares in case of inadequate profits in any year. \u25cf Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity. \u25cf Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is significant risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation. (ix)Risk pertaining to covered call strategy Incorrectly pricing the option premium before writing the covered call by ignoring factors which determine pricing like number of days to expiry, adjustment with respect to announced corporate actions like dividend etc. (x) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending As with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate",
    "securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss of opportunity. (xi) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt The Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive. \u25cf Limited Liquidity & Price Risk There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the ability of the investor to resell them. \u25cf Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk The Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in th e underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors' Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However, many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length o f time required to 12 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may be lower than the amount due from that Obligor. \u25cf Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs In the event of prepayments, investo rs may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs). \u25cf Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings",
    "event of prepayments, investo rs may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs). \u25cf Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could experience losses or delays in the payments. \u25cf Risk of Co-mingling With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing the same into the Collection account especially considering that some of the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to a potential loss. (xii) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI) Perpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital Regulations are referred to as Addition al Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory guidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds as per guidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below: Key Risk Factors: - Risk on coupon servicing Banks As per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow banks to make payment of coupons. NBFCs While NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, co upon can also be deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios. Corporates Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually cumulative and any deferre d coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI. - Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks 13 HDFC Flexi",
    "to breach of capital ratios. Corporates Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually cumulative and any deferre d coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI. - Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks 13 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM As per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET-1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written down. Further, AT -1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non -viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT -1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior t o public sector injection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. - Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer Banks The issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period fr om the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not exercise the call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. NBFCs The NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option th e Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. Corporates There is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call option, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date. (xiii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling Short-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock",
    "sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short s ale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio. (xiv) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs: \u25cf Price Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and 14 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM Infrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. \u25cf Credit Risk: Credit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled. \u25cf Liquidity Risk: This refers to the ease with which s ecurities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for which a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk. \u25cf Reinvestment Risk: Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay -outs, etc.",
    "products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk. \u25cf Reinvestment Risk: Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay -outs, etc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amen dments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions. (xv) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities In repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with the seller agreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater than the original sale price, the difference effectively representing interest. A repo in corporate debt securities is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporat e debt securities as collateral to protect against default. Some of the risks associated with repo in corporate debt are given below: Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy back securities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In case of over the counter (OTC) repo trades, the investment manager will endeavour to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with counterparties having strong credit profiles. Also, the counter -party risk is to an extent mitigated by taking collateral equivalent in value to the transaction after knocking off a minimum haircut on the intrinsic value of the collateral. In the event of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the co rporate debt securities. In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may also provide settlement guarantee. 15 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM Collateral Risk : Collateral risk arises when the market",
    "the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the co rporate debt securities. In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may also provide settlement guarantee. 15 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM Collateral Risk : Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to meet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for replacement o f security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigat e the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by considering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The fund manager or the exchange can then arrange for addi tional collateral from the counterparty, within a prespecified period. If the counterparty is not able to top -up either in form of cash / collateral, it would tantamount to early termination of the repo agreement, and the outstanding amount can be recovered by sale of collateral. (xvi) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes 1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes. 2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads. (xvii) General Risk factors \u2022 Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down",
    "investments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down bec ause of various factors that affect the capital markets in general. \u2022 As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under cer tain circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend Redemption of the units. \u2022 At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest in securities falling within it s investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day -to-day liquidity requirements. 16 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM \u2022 Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark part icularly over a short to medium term period. \u2022 Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies. \u2022 The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset - liability mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments.

A part of the funds may be invested in debt and money market instruments. Investment in Debt securities (including securitised debt) and Money Market Instruments will be as per the limits in the asset allocation table of the Scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI (MF) Regulations.

    "Instruments will be as per the limits in the asset allocation table of the Scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI (MF) Regulations. Investment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their outlook. The Scheme may also invest in the hyb rid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for diversification and subject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time. Subject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may engage in Stock Lending activities. The Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF) Regulations. As part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as futures and options, or any other derivative instruments that are permis sible or may be permissible in future under applicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for restricted purposes as permitted by the regulations. For detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI. For exposure limits to derivatives, refer section \u2018Where will the scheme invest\u2019 under Section II, Part II, Clause A Though every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the AMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved. No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme. Risk Control Investments made by the Scheme would be in accordance with the investment objectives of the scheme and provisions of SEBI (MF) Regulations. Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would incorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio construction process. The risk control process involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes t hat this diversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use various derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time, with an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest. While these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would be completely eliminated.

The portfolio is managed from a long term perspective with an endeavour to keep portfolio turnover ratio low. However, it is expected that there would be a number of subscriptions and redemptions on a daily basis. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable measure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage and transaction cost.

COMPUTATION OF NAV Methodology for Computation of NAV: The Net Asset Value (NAV) per Unit of the Scheme will be computed by dividing the net assets of the Scheme by the number of Units outstanding under the Scheme on the valuation date. The AMC will value its investments according to the valuation norms, as specified in Schedule VIII of the SEBI (MF) Regulations, or such norms as may be specified by SEBI from time to time and as stipulated in the Valuation Policy and Procedures of the Fund, provided in SAI available on website.

In case of any conflict between the Principles of Fair Valuation and valuation guidelines specified by SEBI, the Principles of Fair Valuation shall prevail. NAV of Units under each Scheme/ Plan shall be calculated as shown below: 20 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID NAV (Rs.) = per Unit Market or Fair Value of the Scheme\u2019s Investments + Current Assets - Current Liabilities and Provisions _____________________________________________ No. of Units outstanding under the Scheme/Plan The NAV of the Scheme will be calculated and disclosed at the close of every Business Day. Separate NAV will be calculated and announced for each of Plans/Options. The NAVs will be calculated upto 3 decimals. Units will be allotted upto 3 decimals. Illustration for Computation of NAV: NAV for the Scheme shall be calculated as shown below: Particulars Amount (In INR) Assets Investments (at Market Value) 10,000 (Equity/Debt/Derivatives) Current Assets Interest receivable Dividend Receivables Trades Receivables 1,000 550 1,500 Total Assets (A) 13,050 Current Liabilities Trade Payables Expense Payable Dividend payable 1,500 25 25 Total Liabilities (B) 1,550 Net Assets (C) (A \u2013 B) 11,500 Units Outstanding (D) 1,000 NAV per unit (C/D) \u20b9 11.50 METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATION OF SALE AND REPURCHASE PRICE \u2022 Ongoing Price for subscription (purchase)/ switch-in (from other schemes/ plans of the mutual fund) by investors. (This is the price you need to pay for purchase/ switch-in): 21 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID The Sale Price for a valid purchase will be the Applicable NAV. i.e. Sale Price = Applicable NAV For a valid purchase request of Rs. 10,000 where the applicable NAV is Rs. 11.1234, the units allotted will be: = 10,000 (i.e. purchase amount) 11.1234 (i.e. applicable NAV) = 899.006 units (rounded to three decimals) Charges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above illustration. \u2022 Ongoing Price for redemption (sale)/ switch -outs (to other schemes/plans of the mutual fund) by investors.

(This is the price you will receive for redemptions/ switch-outs): The Repurchase Price for a valid repurchase will be the applicable NAV reduced by any exit load (say 1%). i.e. applicable NAV - (applicable NAV X applicable exit load). For a valid repurchase request where the applicable NAV is Rs. 12.1234, the repurchase price will be: = 12.1234 - (12.1234 X 1.00%) = 12.1234 - 0.1212 = Rs. 12.0022 Therefore, for a repurchase of 899.006 units, the proceeds received by the investor will be - = 899.006 (units) * 12.0022 (Repurchase price) = Rs. 10,790.02 (rounded to two decimals) Charges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above illustration. While determining the price of the units, the mutual fund shall ensure that the repurchase price of an open ended scheme is not lower than 97 per cent of the Net Asset Value.

DEFINITIONS / INTERPRETATION Visit: https://www.hdfcfund.com/statutory-disclosure/offer-document-disclosures B. RISK FACTORS \u25a0 Scheme Specific Risk Factors: Some of the specific risk factors related to the Scheme include, but are not limited to the following: (i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments \u25cf Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks. \u25cf Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk. \u25cf While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u25cf Scheme's",
    "scheme portfolio risk. \u25cf While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u25cf Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances. (ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities \u2022 The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates. \u2022 Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u2022 Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of the issuers. \u2022 Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgr aded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's c redit quality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis. \u2022 Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme. \u2022 Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest",
    "the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme. \u2022 Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on 27 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed. \u2022 Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in the Scheme's portfolio. \u2022 Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price -risk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government Securities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the sense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by movement in interest rates in the financial system. \u2022 Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities.",
    "types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated bonds. \u2022 The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest i n lower rated / unrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio. \u2022 As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securiti es that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securiti es begin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It also varies dependin g on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically. (iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: Except for any security of an associate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a stock exchange (\u201cunlisted Securities\u201d) which in general are subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value. \u2022 Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than rated instruments due to adverse economic",
    "may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value. \u2022 Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer -specific developments. Such investments display increased price sensitivity t o changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities. 28 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID (iv) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated securities The risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to the risk factors associated with debt instruments. \u2022 Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and could include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter o f comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity could be either related or non -related to the issuer like a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of the credit e nhancement provider, as well as the issuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan pools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer. \u2022 Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit enhancements. Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold. \u2022 Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the",
    "Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold. \u2022 Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case o f SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, apart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit risk. (v) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri-party Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL). As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's contribution if there is a residual lo ss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non - defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In additi on, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member). 29 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment,",
    "of any settlement obligations. In additi on, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member). 29 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the defaul t fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund. (vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities \u25cf Currency Risk: Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian Rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related, can differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to their interest rate cycles. \u25cf Credit Risk: Investment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with rating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency. \u25cf Taxation Risk: In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI) under section \u201c Special Consideration\u201d, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges based on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation. The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its investment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed",
    "tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation. The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its investment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing / evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All these may entail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk: Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject co uld differ materially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively. \u25cf Country Risk: The Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisd iction for execution of trades or otherwise. 30 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID \u25cf To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time. \u2022 Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities: In case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by regulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in permissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity. (vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives \u25cf The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders'",
    "permissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity. (vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives \u25cf The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices. \u25cf Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies. \u25cf The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. \u25cf Credit Risk: The credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. \u25cf Market Risk: Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. \u25cf Illiquidity risk: This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of liquidity in the market. Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate Futures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. (viii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares \u25cf Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount",
    "the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. (viii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares \u25cf Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non-cumulative preference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on preference shares in case of inadequate profits in any year. \u25cf Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity. 31 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID \u25cf Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is significant risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation. (ix)Risk pertaining to covered call strategy Incorrectly pricing the option premium before writing the covered call by ignoring factors which determine pricing like number of days to expiry, adjustment with respect to announced corporate actions like dividend etc. (x) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending As with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the term s of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss of opportunity. (xi) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt The Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive. \u25cf Limited Liquidity & Price Risk There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the ability of the investor to resell them. \u25cf Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk The Credit",
    "that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive. \u25cf Limited Liquidity & Price Risk There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the ability of the investor to resell them. \u25cf Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk The Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors' Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancem ent facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However, many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length o f time required to realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may be lower than the amount due from that Obligor. \u25cf Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs). \u25cf Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could experience losses or delays in the payments. \u25cf Risk of Co-mingling 32 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing the same into the Collection account especially considering that some of the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to a potential loss. (xii) Risk",
    "be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to a potential loss. (xii) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI) Perpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital Regulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory guidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds as per guidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below: Key Risk Factors: - Risk on coupon servicing Banks As per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow banks to make payment of coupons. NBFCs While NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can also be deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios. Corporates Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI. - Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks As per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET- 1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written down. Further, AT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and",
    "a bank is deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. - Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer Banks The issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period from the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not exercise the call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. 33 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID NBFCs The NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. Corporates There is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call option, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date. (xiii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling Short-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price). If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio. (xiv) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs: \u25cf Price Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis owing to market movements. The ex tent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market conditions, factors",
    "portfolio. (xiv) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs: \u25cf Price Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis owing to market movements. The ex tent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. \u25cf Credit Risk: Credit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled. \u25cf Liquidity Risk: This refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for which a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk. \u25cf Reinvestment Risk: Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay -outs, etc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators 34 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions. (xv) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt",
    "as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions. (xv) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities In repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with the seller agreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater than the original sale price, the difference effectively representing interest. A repo in corporate debt securities is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporate debt securities as collateral to protect against default. Some of the risks associated with repo in corporate debt are given below: Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy back securities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In case of over the counter (OTC) repo trades, the investment manager will endeavour to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with counterparties having strong credit profiles. Also, the counter-party risk is to an extent mitigated by taking collateral equivalent in value to the transaction after knocking off a minimum haircut on the intrinsic value of the collateral. In the event of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate debt securities. In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may also provide settlement guarantee. Collateral Risk: Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to meet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for replacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security t han required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes,",
    "of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security t han required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by considering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The fund manager or the exchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a prespecified period. If the counterparty is not able to top-up either in form of cash / collateral, it would tantamount to early termination of the repo agreement, and the outstanding amount can be recovered by sale of collateral. (xvi) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes 1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes. 2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads. (xvii) General Risk factors \u2022 Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt 35 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down because of various factors that affect the capital markets in general. \u2022 As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under certain circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend Redemption of the units. \u2022 At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest in securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the",
    "certain circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend Redemption of the units. \u2022 At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest in securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash or cash equivalent or inv est the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity requirements. \u2022 Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to medium term period. \u2022 Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies. \u2022 The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset -liability mismatch and therefore, re quiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments. C. RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES Risk Mitigation measures for investments in equity / equity related and debt instruments \u2022 The Scheme aims to maintain a well-diversified equity portfolio comprising stocks across various sectors of the economy. This shall aid in managing concentration risk and sector specific risks. \u2022 The Scheme targets to maintain exposure across different market cap segments - i.e. large, mid-cap and small cap. This shall aid in managing volatility and also improve liquidity. \u2022 Any investments in debt securities would be undertaken after assessing the associated credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Credit Evaluation Policy The credit evaluation policy of the AMC entails evaluation of credit fundamentals of each investment opportunity. Some of the factors that are evaluated inter -alia may include outlook on the sector, parentage, quality of management, and overall financial strength of the credit. The AMC utilises ratings of recognized rating agencies as an input in the credit evaluation process. Investments in bonds and debenture are usually in instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by a recognized rating agency. In line with clause 12.12 of Master Circular, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals",
    "of recognized rating agencies as an input in the credit evaluation process. Investments in bonds and debenture are usually in instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by a recognized rating agency. In line with clause 12.12 of Master Circular, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals for investments in unrated instruments. The AMC Board and the Trustee shall approve the detailed parameters for such investments. The details of such investments would be communicated by the AMC to the Trustee in their periodical reports. It would also be clearly mentioned in the reports, how the parameters have be en complied with. However, in case any security does not fall under the parameters, the prior approval of Board of AMC and Trustee shall be sought. Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to sell / liquidate a security at short notice at prevailing market prices or without incurring impact cost. While government bonds, money market instruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easie r to sell, corporate bonds and other instruments typically face higher liquidity risk. Further, higher rated securities normally are more liquid compared to lower rated securities. As a result, different portfolios will face different levels of liquidity risk based on the underlying portfolio composition. Some of the strategies to reduce liquidity risk are creating 36 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID portfolios that are diversified across maturities, ratings, types of securities, etc. in line with the fund objectives, regulations and investment strategy. Credit Risk: Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence, credit risk faced by different schemes will be different based on the underlying portfolio / investment strategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Each of the scheme/portfolio will endeav our to maintain adequate diversification across issuers / sectors in line with scheme objectives, regulations and investment strategy. Unrated investments, if any, would require specific approval from a committee constituted for the purpose. Debt Derivatives Risk: The AMC has provision for using derivative instruments for portfolio balancing and hedging purposes. Interest Rate Swaps will be done with approved counter parties under pre approved ISDA agreements. Mark to Market of swaps, netting off of cash flow and default provision clauses will",
    "for the purpose. Debt Derivatives Risk: The AMC has provision for using derivative instruments for portfolio balancing and hedging purposes. Interest Rate Swaps will be done with approved counter parties under pre approved ISDA agreements. Mark to Market of swaps, netting off of cash flow and default provision clauses will be provided as per standard practice on a reciprocal basis. Interest Rate Swaps and other derivative instruments will be used as per local (RBI and SEBI) regulatory guidelines. Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk of change in the NAVs due to change in overall market yields. The change in value of a security, for a given change in yield, is higher for a security with higher duration and vice versa. Hence portfolios with higher duration will have highe r volatility. The AMC shall strive to actively manage the duration of the respective funds based on the prevailing market conditions / outlook of interest rates, keeping in mind the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable regulations. Concentration Risk: The AMC will attempt to mitigate this risk by maintaining adequate diversification across issuers/ sectors / instrument type in line with the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable regulations. This will also be managed by keeping prudent investment limits on any particular industry or issuer or issuer group based on the size, credit profile, etc. to reduce issuer or industry specific risk. Risk Mitigation measures for investments in Non-Convertible Preference Shares: Credit Risk - To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in -depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Liquidity Risk - The Fund endeavours to invest in preference shares of those companies which have relatively better market acceptability amongst market participants that increases the probability of secondary sale in case an exit from the investment is required. Unsecured in nature - The Fund endeavours to mitigate this risk by exercising due diligence while assessing the business, financial and management risks of the company before investing. Risk Mitigation factors relating to investment in Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI): \u2022 Risk on coupon servicing and Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks: The risks on coupon servicing or principal write down/ conversion to equity are mitigated, to a certain extent, if the investee bank has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory",
    "in Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI): \u2022 Risk on coupon servicing and Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks: The risks on coupon servicing or principal write down/ conversion to equity are mitigated, to a certain extent, if the investee bank has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory guidelines. Hence, an in -depth credit evaluation of each ba nk is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed. 37 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID Investment is done only in the AT -1 bonds of banks with strong credit worthiness, in our assessment. This, in turn, reduces the risk of its capital position falling below regulatory requirements and / or reaching PONV. Risk of write-down or conversion into equity is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. \u2022 Risk on coupon servicing NBFCs These risks are mitigated, to certain extent, if the investee NBFC has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory guidelines. Hence, an in-depth credit evaluation of each NBFC is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed. Corporates To mitigate this risk, an in -depth credit evaluation of each corporate is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, industry position, market share e tc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Additionally, given that the coupon is usually cumulative in nature and the corporate is restricted from paying any dividends till all previous dues are paid to the perpetual bond investor, the company has adequate incentive to not defer coupon on PDIs. \u2022 Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer Banks While the issuer bank does have an option to not exercise the first call, experience suggests that all Indian banks till now have exercised the call option during the call period. We believe that banks are cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to risk of not exercising the call option",
    "the issuer bank does have an option to not exercise the first call, experience suggests that all Indian banks till now have exercised the call option during the call period. We believe that banks are cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to risk of not exercising the call option at the first call date. Further, as we invest in issuers with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to understand the importance of exercising the call as the part of their long term capital raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of call option exercise can lead to increase in cost of AT1 bonds for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond tenors) and impact the bank's profitability adversely. Given the importance of AT1 instruments for prudently managing the capital levels and improving the returns for the equity holders, we are of the opinion that banks would choose to service the interest on AT1 bonds and exercise the first call option on AT1 bonds, as they have done in the past. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual instrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the annual call on these instruments would enable the bank to call the bond on any of the subsequent annual call options dates. NBFCs and Corporates While the issuer is not obligated to exercise the call option on first call date, the coupon step -up usually provides financial incentive to the Issuer to exercise the call option. Further, as we invest in issuer with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to be cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to exercising the call as the part of their long term resource raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of first call option exercise can lead to increase in cost of PDI for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond tenors) and impact the issuer's profitability adversely. Finally, in case th e issuer is unable to call the perpetual instrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the coupon step up also compensates the investor for extended holding period. While these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would be completely eliminated. II.

Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs), the proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling his loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much before the maturity of the underlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from borrowers. Typically, the transaction is provided with a limited amount of credit enhancement (as stipulated by the rating agency for a target rating), which provides protection to investors against defaults by the underlying borrowers. Generally available asset classes for securitisation in India are: \u25cf Commercial vehicles \u25cf Auto and two wheeler pools \u25cf Mortgage pools (residential housing loans) \u25cf Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans \u25cf Corporate loans/receivables Investment / Risk Mitigation Strategy 1. Risk profile of securitised debt vis-\u00e0-vis risk appetite of the Scheme The risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities at the same level of credit rating. Se curitised debt offers additional income (spread) over a debt security of similar rating and maturity, which enables the scheme to optimize its income without taking any additional credit risk. Securitised debt is generally less liquid, however, investment in securitised debt is made to maintain a diversified portfolio of debt securities that optimizes return without increasing the overall risk profile of the Scheme. 2. Policy relating to originators based on nature of originator, track record, NPAs, losses in earlier securitised debt, etc The originator is an entity (like banks, non-banking finance companies, corporates etc), which has initially provided the loan & is also generally responsible for servicing the loans. The schemes will invest in securitised debt of",
    "originators based on nature of originator, track record, NPAs, losses in earlier securitised debt, etc The originator is an entity (like banks, non-banking finance companies, corporates etc), which has initially provided the loan & is also generally responsible for servicing the loans. The schemes will invest in securitised debt of originators with at least investment grade credit rating and established track record. A detailed evaluation of originator is done before the investment is made in securitised debt of any originator on various parameters given below: \u25cf Track record The investment in securitised debt is done based on origination and underwriting process and capabilities of the originator, overview of corporate structure, group to which they belong, experience of the company in the business & how long they have been in the business, financial condition of the company, credit rating, past performance of similar pools by the originator, etc. \u25cf Willingness to pay through credit enhancement facilities etc. Credit enhancement is provided by the originator, as indicated by rating agencies, so as to adequately cover the defaults and acts as a risk mitigation measure. The size of the credit enhancement as indicated by rating agency depends on the originator's track record, past delinquencies, pattern of the portfolio & characteristics of the pool vis-a-vis of the portfolio, nature of the asset class. \u25cf Ability to pay The quality of the origination impacts the performance of the underlying asset & thus originators with strong systems and processes in place can eliminate poor quality assets. A robust risk management system of the originator and availability of MIS reports on timely basis, results in creation of strong asset portfolio. \u25cf Business Risk Assessment The business risk assessment of originator / underlying borrower also includes detailed credit assessment wherein following factors are also considered: - Outlook for the economy (domestic and global) - Outlook for the industry 42 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID - Company specific factors In addition, a detailed review and assessment of rating rationale is done along with interactions with the company as well as the rating agency. All investment in securitised debt is done after taking into account, the Critical Evaluation Parameters (for pool loan and single loan securitisation transactions) regarding the originator / underlying issuer as mentioned below: \u25cf Default track record/ frequent alteration of redemption conditions / covenants \u25cf High leverage ratios of the ultimate borrower (for single -sell downs) - both",
    "after taking into account, the Critical Evaluation Parameters (for pool loan and single loan securitisation transactions) regarding the originator / underlying issuer as mentioned below: \u25cf Default track record/ frequent alteration of redemption conditions / covenants \u25cf High leverage ratios of the ultimate borrower (for single -sell downs) - both on a standalone basis as well on a consolidated level/ group level \u25cf Higher proportion of reschedulement of underlying assets of the pool or loan, as the case may be \u25cf Higher proportion of overdue assets of the pool or the underlying loan, as the case may be \u25cf Poor reputation in market \u25cf Insufficient track record of servicing of the pool or the loan, as the case may be. 3. Risk mitigation strategies for investments with each kind of originator Investments are based on assessment of following parameters, so as to mitigate risk associated with such investment: a. Credit quality, size and reach of the originator b. Nature of receivables/asset category i.e. cars, construction equipment, commercial vehicles, personal loans etc. c. Collection process, infrastructure and follow-up mechanism d. Quality of MIS e. Credit cum liquidity enhancement f. Credit appraisal norms of originator g. Asset Quality - portfolio delinquency levels h. Past performance of rated pools i. Pool Characteristics - seasoning, Loan-to-value ratios, geographic diversity etc. 4. The level of diversification with respect to the underlying assets, and risk mitigation measures for less diversified investments Diversification of underlying assets is achieved through a) prudent mix of asset categories - i.e. cars (new, used), commercial vehicles, construction equipment, unsecured loans to individuals or small & medium enterprises b) total number of contracts in a pool c) average ticket size of loans and d) geographical distribution. Risk mitigation measures for less d iversified investments in pools is accomplished through the size of credit enhancement, seasoning or loan to value ratios.

In case of asset backed pools (ABS), evaluation of the pool assets is done considering the following factors: (Refer the table above which illustrates the averages of parameters considered while selecting the pool) \u2022 Size of the loan \u2022 Average original maturity of the pool \u2022 Loan to Value Ratio \u2022 Average seasoning of the pool \u2022 Default rate distribution \u2022 Geographical Distribution \u2022 Credit enhancement facility \u2022 Liquid facility \u2022 Structure of the pool 5. Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation The illustrative average seasoning of the debt by originator prior to securitisation is given above in table (Refer Point 4). Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation in the case of asset pools is in the form of seasoning of loans to various asset classes (cars, commercial vehicles, etc.) and generally varies from one month to six months depending on the nature of asset. 6. Minimum retention percentage by originator of debts to be securitised While minimum retention percentage by originator is not prescribed, any amount retained by the originator through subordination is viewed positively at the time of making investment and generally varies from 5% to 10%. 44 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID 7.

    "Cap Fund-SID 7. The mechanism to tackle conflict of interest when the mutual fund invests in securitised debt of an originator and the originator in turn makes investments in that particular scheme of the fund All proposals for invest ment in securitised debt are evaluated by the credit analyst based on several parameters such as nature of underlying asset category, pool characteristics, asset quality, credit rating of the securitisation transaction, and credit cum liquidity enhancement available. Investment in securitised debt in any scheme is made by the respective fund manager in line with the investment objective of that scheme. 8. The resources and mechanism of individual risk assessment with the AMC for monitoring investment in securitised debt (in general) Investment in securitised debt is monitored regularly with regards to its performance on various parameters such as collection efficiency, delinquencies, prepayments and utilization of credit enhancement. Information on these parameters is available through monthly reports from Pool Trustees and through information disseminated by the rating agencies. Monthly performance report is released by the credit analyst to the fund management team and the fund management team periodically reviews the same. Trading in Derivatives \u2022 The Scheme may take derivatives position based on the opportunities available subject to the guidelines provided by SEBI from time to time and in line with the overall investment objective of the Scheme. \u2022 The Scheme intends to use derivatives mainly for the purpose of hedging and portfolio balancing. Losses may arise as a result of using derivatives, but these are likely to be compensated by the gains on the underlying cash instruments held by the Scheme. \u2022 The Scheme may take position in derivative instruments like Futures, Options, and such other derivative instruments as may be permitted by SEBI from time to time. Exposure to Derivatives The exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by SEBI vide its clause 12.25 of Master Circular and as amended from time to time are as follows: Position Limits The position limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by clause 12.25 of the Master Circular read with SEBI circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-2/P/CIR/2024/140 dated October 15, 2024 and SEBI circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD-1/P/CIR/2025/79 dated May 29, 2025 are as follows: i.

Position limit for Mutual Funds in index options contracts a) The Mutual Fund position limit in all index options contracts at PAN level shall be as follows: i. Net end of day FutEq OI limit for options to be \u20b91,500 cr. and ii. Gross end of day FutEq OI to be \u20b910,000 cr. (i.e. neither gross long FutEq OI nor gross short FutEq OI shall exceed \u20b910,000 cr.) This limit would be applicable on open positions in all option s contracts on a particular Underlying Index. ii. Position limit for Mutual Funds in index futures contracts a) The Mutual Fund position limit in all index futures contracts on a particular Underlying Index shall be higher of 15% of futures OI for that index or \u20b9500 cr. b) This limit would be applicable on open positions in all futures contracts on a particular Underlying Index. 45 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID c) The above stated position limits for index futures would be measured on gross notional basis. The position limits shall be computed on a gross basis at the level of MF and on a net basis at the level of schemes of MF. Formulation of Open Interest (OI) i. OI in derivatives shall be measured at portfolio level by computing the net Delta adjusted open positions across futures and options for an underlying at a given point in time. Delta denotes sensitivity of price movement of derivative position with respect to that of the underlying. Accordingly, long futures have a delta of +1 times notional. For options, delta will range between 0 and +1 times notional for long calls and between 0 and \u20131 times notional for long puts. In case of short options position, effective delta for short calls is negative and that of short put is positive. ii. Gross addition of such net Future Equivalent Open Interest (FutEq OI) across all the Unique Client Codes would form the FutEq OI for the Stock/Index derivatives. iii. Additional position limit for hedging In addition to the position limits at point (i) and (ii) above, Mutual Funds may take exposure in equity index derivatives subject to the following limits: 1. Aggregate short positions in index derivatives (short futures, short calls and long puts) shall not exceed (FutEq terms for Index",

Aggregate long positions in index derivatives (long futures, long calls and short puts) shall not exceed (FutEq ter ms for Index options and gross notional terms for Index futures) the Mutual Fund\u2019s holding of cash and cash equivalent, government securities, T -Bills and similar instruments. iv. Position limit for Mutual Funds for stock based derivative contracts The Mutual Fund position limit in a derivative contract on a particular underlying stock, i.e. stock option contracts and stock futures contracts will be as follows: The combined futures and options position limit shall be 30% of the applicable Market Wide Position Limit (MWPL). v. Position limit for each Scheme of a Mutual Fund The Scheme-wise position limit requirements shall be: 1. The gross open positions across all derivative contracts on a particular underlying stock should not exceed the higher of: 1% of the free float market capitalization (in terms of number of shares). or 5% of the open interest in the derivative contracts on a particular underlying stock (in terms of number of contracts). 2. These position limits would be applicable on the combine d position in all derivative contracts on an underlying stock at a Stock exchange. 3. For index based contracts, Mutual Funds shall disclose the total open interest held by its Scheme or all Schemes put together in a particular Underlying Index, if such open interest equals to or exceeds 15% of the open interest of all derivative contracts on that Underlying Index. Exposure Limits The exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by clauses 12.24 and 12.25 of Master Circular, are as follows: 46 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID 1. The cumulative gross exposure through equity, debt, derivative positions (including fixed income derivatives), repo transactions in corporate debt securities, credit default swaps, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Infrastructure Investment T rusts (InvITs), other permitted securities/assets and such other securities/assets as may be permitted by SEBI from time to time shall not exceed 100% of the net assets of the scheme.

Security wise hedge positions using derivatives such as Interest Rate Swaps, call options written under the covered call Strategy and any other positions specifically exempted under SEBI guidelines from time to time, will not be considered in calculating above exposure. 2. Mutual Funds shall not write options or purchase instrum ents with em -bedded written options (except for exposure on account of call option written under the covered call strategy, if permitted under the Scheme). 3. The total exposure related to option premium paid must not exceed 20% of the net assets of the scheme. 4. Cash or cash equivalents i.e. Government Securities, T-Bills and Repo on Government Securities having residual maturity of less than 91 days may be treated as not creating any exposure. 5. Exposure due to hedging positions may not be included in the a bove mentioned limits subject to the following: a) Hedging positions are the derivative positions that reduce possible losses on an existing position in securities and till the existing position remains. b) Hedging positions cannot be taken for existing derivative positions.

A call option can be written only on shares which are not hedged using other derivative contracts. e) The total gross exposure related to option premium paid and received will not exceed 20% of the net assets of the Schemes. Exposure limits on Credit Default Swaps (CDS) Exposure through CDS (Notional amount of both CDS bought and sold) shall not exceed 10% of AUM of scheme and shall be within the overall limit of derivatives. Exposure limits on Interest Rate Futures (IRF) The exposure limits for trading in Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) by Mutual Funds specified by clause 12.25.9 of Master Circular are as follows: i. To reduce interest rate risk in a debt portfolio, mutual funds may hedge the portfolio or part of the portfolio (including one or more securities) on weighted average modified duration basis by using Interest Rate Futures (IRFs). The maximum extent of short position that may be taken in IRFs to hedge interest rate risk of the portfolio or part of the portfolio, is as per the formula given below: (Portfolio Modified Duration* Market Value of the Portfolio) (Futures Modified Duration *Futures Price/PAR) 48 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID ii. In case the IRF used for hedging the interest rate risk has different underlying security(s) than the existing position being hedged, it would result in imperfect hedging. iii. Imperfect hedging using IRFs may be considered to be exempted from the gross exposure, upto maximum of 20% of the net assets of the scheme, subject to the following: a) Exposure to IRFs is created only for hedging the interest rate risk based on the weighted average modified duration of the bond portfolio or part of the portfolio. b) Mutual Funds are permitted to resort to imperfect hedging, without it being considered under the gross exposure limits, if and only if, the correlation between the portfolio or part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged portions, if any) and the IRF is atleast 0.9 at the time of initiation of",

In case of any subsequent deviation from the correlation criteria, the same may be re balanced within 5 working days and if not rebalanced within the timeline, the derivative positions created for hedging shall be considered under the gross exposure computed in terms of clause 12.24.1 of Master Circular. The correlation should be calculated for a period of last 90 days. Explanation: If the fund manager intends to do imperfect hedging upto 15% of the portfolio using IRFs on weighted average modified duration basis, either of the following conditions need to be complied with: i. The correlation for past 90 days between the portfolio and the IRF is at least 0.9 or ii. The correlation for past 90 days between the part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged portions, if any) i.e. at least 15% of the net asset of the scheme (including one or mo re securities) and the IRF is at least 0.9. c) At no point of time, the net modified duration of part of the portfolio being hedged should be negative. d) The portion of imperfect hedging in excess of 20% of the net assets of the scheme should be considered as creating exposure and shall be included in the computation of gross exposure in terms of clause 12.24.1 of Master Circular. \u2022 Debt Market In India The instruments available in Indian Debt Market are classified into two categories, namely Government and Non - Government debt.

The price and yield on various debt instruments fluctuate from time to time depending upon the macro economic situation, inflation rate, overall liquidity position, foreign exchange scenario etc. Also, the price and yield vary according to maturity profile, credit risk etc. Generally, for instruments issued by a non -Government entity (corporate / PSU bonds), the yield is higher than the yield on a Government Security with corresponding maturity. The difference, known as credit spread, depends on the credit rating of the entity. \u2022 Overseas Debt Market The nature and number of debt instruments available in international debt markets is very wide. In terms of diverse instruments as well as liquidity, overseas debt markets offer great depth and are extremely well developed. Investment in international debt greatly expands the universe of top quality debt, which is no longer restricted to the limited papers available in the domestic debt market. The higher rated overseas sovereign, quasi - government and corporate debt offer lower default risk in addition to offering a high degree of liquidity since these are traded across major international markets. Investments in rated international debt offer multiple benefits of risk reduction, a much wider universe of top quality debt and also potential gains from currency movements. Investments in international markets are most often in U.S. dollars, though the Euro, Pound Sterling and the Yen are also major currencies. Though this market is geographically well spread across global financial centres, the markets in the U.S., European Union and Lo ndon offer the most liquidity and depth of instruments. Besides factors specific to the country / issuer, international bond prices are influenced to a large extent by a number of other factors; chief among these are the international economic outlook, cha nges in interest rates in major economies, trading volumes in overseas markets, cross currency movements among major currencies, rating changes of countries / corporations and major political changes globally.

Any restriction on Redemption or suspension of Redemption of the Units in the Scheme(s) of the Mutual Fund shall be made applicable only after specific approval of the Board of Directors of the AMC and Trustee Company and thereafter, immediately informing the same to SEBI. 63 HDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID The AMC / Trustee reserves the right to change / modify the provisions",

Cut off timing for subscriptions/ redemptions/ switches This is the time before which your application (complete in all respects) should reach the official points of acceptance. The below cut -off timings and applicability of NAV shall be applicable in respect of valid applications received at the Official Point(s) of Acceptance on a Business Day: A] For Purchase (including switch-in) of any amount: \u25cf In respect of valid applications received upto 3.00 p.m. and where the funds for the entire amount are available for utilization before the cut- off time i.e. credited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut- off time - the closing NAV of the day shall be applicable. \u25cf In respect of valid applications received after 3.00 p.m. and where the funds for the entire amount are credited to the bank account of the Scheme either at any time on the same day or before the cut-off time of the next Business Day i.e. available for utilization before the cut-off time of the next Business Day - the closing NAV of the next Business Day shall be applicable. \u25cf Irrespective of the time of receipt of application, where the funds for the entire amount are credited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time on any subsequent Business Day i.e. available for utilization before the cut-off time on any subsequent Business Day - the closing NAV of such subsequent Business Day shall be applicable. B] For Switch-ins of any amount: For determining the applicable NAV, the following shall be ensured: \u25cf Application for switch-in is received before the applicable cut-off time. \u25cf Funds for the entire amount of subscription/purchase as per the switch-in request are credited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time. \u25cf The funds are available for utilization before the cut-off time. \u25cf In case of \u2018switch\u2019 transactions from one scheme to another, the allocation shall be in line with redemption payouts. In case of switches, the",
    "request are credited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time. \u25cf The funds are available for utilization before the cut-off time. \u25cf In case of \u2018switch\u2019 transactions from one scheme to another, the allocation shall be in line with redemption payouts.

Since different payment modes have different settlement cycles including electronic transactions (as per arrangements with Payment Aggregators / Banks / Exchanges etc), it may happen that the investor's account is debited, but the money is not credited within cut-off time on the same date to the Scheme's bank account, leading to a gap / delay in Unit allotment. Investors are therefore urged to use the most efficient electronic payment modes to avoid delays in realization of funds and consequently in Unit allotment.

    "guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme. 8. Risk Profile of the Scheme Mutual Fund Units involve investment risks including the possible loss of principal. Please read the details on risk factors carefully before investment. Scheme specific Risk Factors are summarized below: (i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments \u25cf Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks. \u25cf Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk. \u25cf While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u25cf Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances. (ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities \u2022 The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme is expected to increase fro m a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates. \u2022 Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and m ay lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u2022 Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of the issuers. \u2022 Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in economic",
    "in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis. \u2022 Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities before their maturity date, in periods of declining inter est rates. The possibility of such prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme. 7 HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM \u2022 Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed. \u2022 Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subs equent decline in the value of securities held in the Scheme's portfolio. \u2022 Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price -risk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices",
    "in the Scheme's portfolio. \u2022 Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price -risk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price -risk is not unique to Government Securities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Sec urities are unique in the sense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by movement in interest rates in the financial system. \u2022 Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e .g. corporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated bonds. \u2022 The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio. \u2022 As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securit ies that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securit ies begin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It also",
    "interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securit ies begin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It also varies dependi ng on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically. (iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: Except for any security of an associate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a stock exchange (\u201cunlisted Securities\u201d) which in general 8 HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM are subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value. \u2022 Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer -specific developments. Such investments display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities. (iv) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated securities The risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to the risk factors associated with debt instruments. \u2022 Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and could include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter of comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity could be either related or non -related to the issuer like a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypo thecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for CE rated",
    "institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypo thecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the issuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan pools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer. \u2022 Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit enhancements. Debt securities lack a well -developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold. \u2022 Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, apart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit risk. (v) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri -party Repo trades are settled centrally through the in frastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks 9 HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM considerably for transactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to",
    "trades are settled centrally through the in frastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks 9 HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM considerably for transactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL). As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's contribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non -defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In addition, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member). CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo t rades and the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is c alled upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund. (vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities \u25cf Currency Risk: Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian Rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co -related, can differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than",
    "income may be adversely affected by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co -related, can differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to their interest rate cycles. \u25cf Credit Risk: Investment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with rating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency. \u25cf Taxation Risk: In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI) under section \u201c Special Consideration\u201d, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges based o n the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation. The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its investment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the 10 HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM changing / evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All these may entail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, trans action costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk: Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject could differ materially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively. \u25cf Country Risk: The Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration,",
    "arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi - lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of trades or otherwise. \u25cf To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time. \u2022 Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities: In case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by regulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in permissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity. (vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives \u25cf The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with s tocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices. \u25cf Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies. \u25cf The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. \u25cf Credit Risk: 11 HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM The credit r isk in derivative transaction is the risk that",
    "strategies. \u25cf The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. \u25cf Credit Risk: 11 HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM The credit r isk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. \u25cf Market Risk: Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. \u25cf Illiquidity risk: This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of liquidity in the market. Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate Futures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. (viii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares \u25cf Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non - cumulative preference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on pr eference shares in case of inadequate profits in any year. \u25cf Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity. \u25cf Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is significant risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation. (ix) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending As with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the",
    "the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss of opportunity. (x) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt The Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive. \u25cf Limited Liquidity & Price Risk There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the ability of the investor to resell them. 12 HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM \u25cf Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk The Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors' Representative. Delinque ncies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However, many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required to realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may be lower than the amount due from that Obligor. \u25cf Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in teno r and yield. Also, any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs). \u25cf Bankruptcy",
    "amount due from that Obligor. \u25cf Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in teno r and yield. Also, any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs). \u25cf Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an inve stor could experience losses or delays in the payments. \u25cf Risk of Co-mingling With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing the same into the Collection account especially considering that some of the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from other funds of o riginator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to a potential loss. (xi) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI) Perpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital Regulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory guidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds as per guidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below: Key Risk Factors: - Risk on coupon servicing Banks As per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow banks to make payment of coupons. NBFCs 13 HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM While NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can also be deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios. Corporates Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall",
    "at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can also be deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios. Corporates Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the origin al coupon rate of the PDI. - Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks As per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET-1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT -1 bonds can get written down. Further, AT -1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non -viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT -1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. - Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer Banks The issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period from the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not exercise the call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. NBFCs The NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. Corporates There is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call option, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date. (xii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling Short-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and",
    "the call exercise date. (xii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling Short-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock c orrects, Short seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock 14 HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Shor t positions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio. (xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs: \u25cf Price Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. \u25cf Credit Risk: Credit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. S ecurities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled. \u25cf Liquidity Risk: This refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable s ecurities/instruments for which a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk. \u25cf Reinvestment Risk: Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be repatriation",
    "from the market price of comparable s ecurities/instruments for which a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk. \u25cf Reinvestment Risk: Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay -outs, etc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions. (xiv) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities In repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with the seller agreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater than the original sale price, the difference effectively represent ing interest. A repo in corporate debt securities is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporate debt 15 HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM securities as collateral to protect against default. Some of the risks associated with repo in corporate debt are given below: Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy back securities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In case of over the counter (OTC) repo trades, the investment manager will endeavo ur to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with counterparties having strong credit profiles. Also, the counter -party risk is to an extent mitigated by taking collateral equivalent in value to the transaction after knocking off a minimum haircut on the intrinsic value of the collateral. In the event of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate debt securities. In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the",
    "value to the transaction after knocking off a minimum haircut on the intrinsic value of the collateral. In the event of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate debt securities. In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may also provide settlement guarantee. Collateral Risk : Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to meet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for replacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by considering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The fund manager or the exchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a prespecified period. If the counterparty is not able to top -up either in form of cash / collateral, it would tantamount to early termination of the repo agreement, and the outstanding amount can be recovered by sale of collateral. (xv) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes 1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes. 2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads. (xvi) General Risk factors \u2022 Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The",
    "volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down bec ause of various factors that affect the capital markets in general. \u2022 As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under cer tain 16 HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend Redemption of the units. \u2022 At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest in securities falling within it s investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day -to-day liquidity requirements. \u2022 Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark part icularly over a short to medium term period. \u2022 Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies. \u2022 The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset - liability mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments.

    "time, subject to necessary regulatory approvals. For detailed disclosures, kindly refer Section II. C. WHAT ARE THE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES? The investment objective of the Scheme is to provide long -term capital appreciation by investing predominantly in Large-Cap companies. The Scheme will maintain a minimum exposure of 80% to Large- Cap stocks. The Scheme may also invest upto 20% of AUM in debt and money market securities. The Scheme will remain diversified across key sectors and economic variables. The Scheme may also invest in the hybrid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for diversification and subject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time. Subject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may engage in Stock Lending activities. Investment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their outlook. The Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF) Regulations. As part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as futures and options, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible in future under applicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for restricted purposes as permitted by the regulations. For detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI. For exposure limits to derivatives, refer section \u2018Where will the scheme invest\u2019 under Section II, Part II, Clause A Though every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the AMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved. No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme. Risk Control Investments made by the Scheme would be in accordance with the investment objectives of the scheme and provisions of SEBI (MF) Regulations. Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would incorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio cons truction process. The risk control process involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this diversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use various derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time, with an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest.

    "also use various derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time, with an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest. While these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would be completely eliminated. 15 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID PORTFOLIO TURNOVER The Scheme is an open -ended Scheme. The portfolio is managed from a long term perspective with an endeavour to keep portfolio turnover ratio low. However, it is expected that there would be a number of subscriptions and redemptions on a daily basis. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable measure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage and transaction cost. D. HOW WILL THE SCHEME BENCHMARK ITS PERFORMANCE? NIFTY 100 Total Returns Index (TRI) As required under clause 1.9 of Master Circular, the benchmark has been selected from amongst those notified by AMFI as the first tier benchmark to be adopted by mutual funds and which are reflective of the category of the scheme. NIFTY 100 is a diversified 100 stock index representing major sectors of the economy. This index intends to measure the performance of large market capitalisation companies. The performance will be benchmarked to the Total Returns Variant of the Index. The Trustee reserves the right to change the benchmark for evaluation of performance of the Scheme from time to time in conformity with the investment objectives and appropriateness of the benchmark subject to SEBI (MF) Regulations, and other prevailing guidelines, if any.

COMPUTATION OF NAV Methodology for Computation of NAV: The Net Asset Value (NAV) per Unit of the Scheme will be computed by dividing the net assets of the Scheme by the number of Units outstanding under the Scheme on the valuation date. The AMC will value its investments according to the valuation norms, as specified in Schedule VIII of the SEBI (MF) Regulations, or such norms as may be specified by SEBI from time to time and as stipulated in the Valuation Policy and Procedures of the Fund, provided in SAI available on website. In case of any conflict between the Principles of Fair Valuation and valuation guidelines specified by SEBI, the Principles of Fair Valuation shall prevail. NAV of Units under each Scheme/ Plan shall be calculated as shown below: NAV (Rs.) = per Unit Market or Fair Value of the Scheme\u2019s Investments + Current Assets - Current Liabilities and Provisions _____________________________________________ No. of Units outstanding under the Scheme/Plan The NAV of the Scheme will be calculated and disclosed at the close of every Business Day. Separate NAV will be calculated and announced for each of Plans/Options. The NAVs will be calculated upto 3 decimals. Units will be allotted upto 3 decimals. Illustration for Computation of NAV: NAV for the Scheme shall be calculated as shown below: Particulars Amount (In INR) Assets Investments (at Market Value) 10,000 21 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID (Equity/Debt/Derivatives) Current Assets Interest receivable Dividend Receivables Trades Receivables 1,000 550 1,500 Total Assets (A) 13,050 Current Liabilities Trade Payables Expense Payable Dividend payable 1,500 25 25 Total Liabilities (B) 1,550 Net Assets (C) (A \u2013 B) 11,500 Units Outstanding (D) 1,000 NAV per unit (C/D) \u20b9 11.50 METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATION OF SALE AND REPURCHASE PRICE \u2022 Ongoing",

(This is the price you need to pay for purchase/ switch-in): The Sale Price for a valid purchase will be the Applicable NAV. i.e. Sale Price = Applicable NAV For a valid purchase request of Rs. 10,000 where the applicable NAV is Rs. 11.1234, the units allotted will be: = 10,000 (i.e. purchase amount) 11.1234 (i.e. applicable NAV) = 899.006 units (rounded to three decimals) Charges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above illustration. \u2022 Ongoing Price for redemption (sale)/ switch -outs (to other schemes/plans of the mutual fund) by investors. (This is the price you will receive for redemptions/ switch-outs): The Repurchase Price for a valid repurchase will be the applicable NAV reduced by any exit load (say 1%). i.e. applicable NAV - (applicable NAV X applicable exit load). For a valid repurchase request where the applicable NAV is Rs. 12.1234, the repurchase price will be: = 12.1234 - (12.1234 X 1.00%) = 12.1234 - 0.1212 = Rs. 12.0022 22 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID Therefore, for a repurchase of 899.006 units, the proceeds received by the investor will be - = 899.006 (units) * 12.0022 (Repurchase price) = Rs. 10,790.02 (rounded to two decimals) Charges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above illustration. While determining the price of the units, the mutual fund shall ensure that the repurchase price of an open ended scheme is not lower than 97 per cent of the Net Asset Value.

DEFINITIONS / INTERPRETATION Visit: https://www.hdfcfund.com/statutory-disclosure/offer-document-disclosures B. RISK FACTORS \u25a0 Scheme Specific Risk Factors: Some of the specific risk factors related to the Scheme include, but are not limited to the following: (i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments \u25cf Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks. \u25cf Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk. \u25cf While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u25cf Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances. (ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities \u2022 The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates. \u2022 Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u2022 Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of the issuers. \u2022 Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgr aded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer,",
    "\u2022 Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgr aded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's c redit quality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis. \u2022 Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme. \u2022 Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on 27 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed. \u2022 Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in the Scheme's portfolio. \u2022 Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price -risk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices",
    "in the Scheme's portfolio. \u2022 Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price -risk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government Securities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the sense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by movement in interest rates in the financial system. \u2022 Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated bonds. \u2022 The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest i n lower rated / unrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio. \u2022 As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securiti es that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securiti es begin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It also varies dependin",
    "to maturity or a specified date when the securiti es begin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It also varies dependin g on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically. (iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: Except for any security of an associate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a stock exchange (\u201cunlisted Securities\u201d) which in general are subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value. \u2022 Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer -specific developments. Such investments display increased price sensitivity t o changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities. 28 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID (iv) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated securities The risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to the risk factors associated with debt instruments. \u2022 Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and could include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter o f comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity could be either related or non -related to the issuer like a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of",
    "Credit enhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of the credit e nhancement provider, as well as the issuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan pools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer. \u2022 Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit enhancements. Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold. \u2022 Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case o f SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, apart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit risk. (v) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri-party Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part",
    "centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL). As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's contribution if there is a residual lo ss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non - defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In additi on, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member). 29 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the defaul t fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund. (vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities \u25cf Currency Risk: Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian Rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related, can differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed",
    "affected by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related, can differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to their interest rate cycles. \u25cf Credit Risk: Investment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with rating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency. \u25cf Taxation Risk: In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI) under section \u201c Special Consideration\u201d, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges based on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation. The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its investment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing / evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All these may entail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk: Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject co uld differ materially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively. \u25cf Country Risk: The Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent",
    "is the risk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisd iction for execution of trades or otherwise. 30 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \u25cf To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time. \u2022 Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities: In case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by regulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in permissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity. (vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives \u25cf The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices. \u25cf Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies. \u25cf The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. \u25cf Credit Risk: The credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of",
    "are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. \u25cf Credit Risk: The credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. \u25cf Market Risk: Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. \u25cf Illiquidity risk: This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of liquidity in the market. Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate Futures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. (viii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares \u25cf Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non-cumulative preference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on preference shares in case of inadequate profits in any year. \u25cf Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity. 31 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \u25cf Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is significant risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation. (ix) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending As with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any",
    "of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss of opportunity. (x) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt The Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive. \u25cf Limited Liquidity & Price Risk There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the ability of the investor to resell them. \u25cf Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk The Credit Enhancement stipulated re presents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affili ate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors' Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess an d sell the Asset. However, many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required to realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may be lower than the amount due from that Obligor. \u25cf Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs). \u25cf Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could experience losses",
    "be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs). \u25cf Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could experience losses or delays in the payments. \u25cf Risk of Co-mingling With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing the same into the Collection account especially considering that some of the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to a potential loss. 32 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID (xi) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI) Perpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital Regulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory guidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds as per g uidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below: Key Risk Factors: - Risk on coupon servicing Banks As per the term s of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow ba nks to make payment of coupons. NBFCs While NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can also be deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios. Corporates Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI. - Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks As per the regulatory",
    "to breach of capital ratios. Corporates Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI. - Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks As per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET- 1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written down. Further, AT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. - Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer Banks The issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period from the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not exercise the call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. NBFCs The NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. Corporates 33 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID There is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call option, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date. (xii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling Short-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock back",
    "the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio. (xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs: \u25cf Price Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. \u25cf Credit Risk: Credit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. S ecurities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled. \u25cf Liquidity Risk: This refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable s ecurities/instruments for which a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk. \u25cf Reinvestment Risk: Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay -outs, etc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory",
    "\u25cf Reinvestment Risk: Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay -outs, etc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions. 34 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID xiv) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities In repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with the seller agreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater than the original sale price, the difference effectively representing interest. A repo in corporate debt securities is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporate debt securities as collateral to protect against default. Some of the risks associated with repo in corporate debt are given below: Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy back securities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In case of over the counter (OTC) repo trades, the investment manager will endeavour to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with counterparties having strong credit profiles. Also, the counter-party risk is to an extent mitigated by taking collateral equivalent in value to the transaction after knocking off a minimum haircut on the intrinsic value of the collateral. In the event of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate debt securities. In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may also provide settlement guarantee. Collateral Risk: Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to meet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo",
    "In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may also provide settlement guarantee. Collateral Risk: Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to meet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for replacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by considering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The fund manager or the exchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a prespecified period. If the counterparty is not able to top-up either in form of cash / collateral, it would tantamount to early termination of the repo agreement, and the outstanding amount can be recovered by sale of collateral. (xv) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes 1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes. 2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads. (xvi) General Risk factors \u2022 Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down beca use of various factors that affect the capital markets in general. \u2022 As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times,",
    "leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down beca use of various factors that affect the capital markets in general. \u2022 As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending 35 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID redemptions) under certain circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend Redemption of the units. \u2022 At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest in securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity requirements. \u2022 Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to medium term period. \u2022 Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies. \u2022 The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset -liability mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments. C. RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES Risk Mitigation measures for investments in equity / equity related and debt instruments \u2022 The Scheme will maintain a minimum exposure of 80% to Large -Cap stocks. These stocks are characterised by a high level of trading volumes imparting relatively high liquidity to the portfolio. \u2022 Within its investment universe, the Scheme aims to maintain a well -diversified equity portfolio comprising stocks across various sectors of the economy. This shall a id in managing concentration risk and sector specific",
    "are characterised by a high level of trading volumes imparting relatively high liquidity to the portfolio. \u2022 Within its investment universe, the Scheme aims to maintain a well -diversified equity portfolio comprising stocks across various sectors of the economy. This shall a id in managing concentration risk and sector specific risks. \u2022 Any investments in debt securities would be undertaken after assessing the associated credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Credit Evaluation Policy The credit evaluation policy o f the AMC entails evaluation of credit fundamentals of each investment opportunity. Some of the factors that are evaluated inter -alia may include outlook on the sector, parentage, quality of management, and overall financial strength of the credit. The AMC utilises ratings of recognized rating agencies as an input in the credit evaluation process. Investments in bonds and debenture are usually in instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by a recognized rating agency. In line with clause 12.12 of Master Circular, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals for investments in unrated instruments. The AMC Board and the Trustee shall approve the detailed parameters for such investments. The details of such investments would be communicated by the AMC to the Trustee in their periodical reports. It would also be clearly mentioned in the reports, how the parameters have been complied with. However, in case any security does not fall under the parameters, the prior approval of Board of AMC and Trustee shall be sought. Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to sell / liquidate a security at short notice at prevailing market prices or without incurring impact cost. While government bonds, money market instruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easier to sell, corporate bonds and other instruments typically face higher liquidity risk. Further, higher rated securities normally are more liquid compared to lower rated securities. As a result, different portfolios will face different levels of liquidity risk based on the underlying portfolio composition. Some of the strategies to reduce liquidity risk are creating portfolios that are diversified across maturities, ratings, types of securities, etc. i n line with the fund objectives, regulations and investment strategy. 36 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID Credit Risk: Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence, credit risk faced by different schemes will be different based on the underlyi ng",
    "types of securities, etc. i n line with the fund objectives, regulations and investment strategy. 36 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID Credit Risk: Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence, credit risk faced by different schemes will be different based on the underlyi ng portfolio / investment strategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, tra ck record etc.). Each of the scheme/portfolio will endeavour to maintain adequate diversification across issuers / sectors in line with scheme objectives, regulations and investment strategy. Unrated investments, if any, would require specific approval fr om a committee constituted for the purpose. Debt Derivatives Risk: The AMC has provision for using derivative instruments for portfolio balancing and hedging purposes. Interest Rate Swaps will be done with approved counter parties under pre approved ISDA agreements. Mark to Market of swaps, netting off of cash flow and default provision clauses will be provided as per standard practice on a reciprocal basis. Interest Rate Swaps and other derivative instruments will be used as per local (RBI and SEBI) regulatory guidelines. Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk of change in the NAVs due to change in overall market yields. The change in value of a security, for a given change in yield, is higher for a security with higher duration and vice versa. Hence portfolios with higher duratio n will have higher volatility. The AMC shall strive to actively manage the duration of the respective funds based on the prevailing market conditions / outlook of interest rates, keeping in mind the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable regulations. Concentration Risk: The AMC will attempt to mitigate this risk by maintaining adequate diversification across issuers/ sectors / instrument type in line with the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable regulations. This will also be managed by keeping prudent investment limits on any particular industry or issuer or issuer group based on the size, credit profile, etc. to reduce issuer or industry specific risk. Risk Mitigation measures for investments in Non-Convertible Preference Shares: Credit Risk - To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in -depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.).",
    "issuer or industry specific risk. Risk Mitigation measures for investments in Non-Convertible Preference Shares: Credit Risk - To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in -depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Liquidity Risk - The Fund endeavours to invest in preference shares of those companies which have relatively better market acceptability amongst market participants that increases the probability of secondary sale in case an exit from the investment is required. Unsecured in nature - The Fund endeavours to mitigate this risk by exercising due diligence while assessing the business, financial and management risks of the company before investing. Risk Mitigation factors relating to investment in Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI): \u2022 Risk on coupon servicing and Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks: The risks on coupon servicing or principal write down/ conversion to equity are mitigated, to a certain extent, if the investee bank has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory guidelines. Hence, an in -depth credit evaluation of each ba nk is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed. Investment is done only in the AT -1 bonds of banks with strong credit worthiness, in our assessment. This, in turn, reduces the risk of its capital position falling below regulatory requirements and / or reaching PONV. 37 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID Risk of write-down or conversion into equity is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. \u2022 Risk on coupon servicing NBFCs These risks are mitigated, to certain extent, if the investee NBFC has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory guidelines. Hence, an in-depth credit evaluation of each NBFC is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed. Corporates To mitigate this risk, an in -depth credit evaluation of each corporate is undertaken,",
    "record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed. Corporates To mitigate this risk, an in -depth credit evaluation of each corporate is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, industry position, market share e tc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Additionally, given that the coupon is usually cumulative in nature and the corporate is restricted from paying any dividends till all previous dues are paid to the perpetual bond investor, the company has adequate incentive to not defer coupon on PDIs. \u2022 Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer Banks While the issuer bank does have an option to not exercise the first call, experience suggests that all Indian banks till now have exercised the call option during the call period. We believe that banks are cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to risk of not exercising the call option at the first call date. Further, as we invest in issuers with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to understand the importance of exercising the call as the part of their long term capital raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of call option exercise can lead to increase in cost of AT1 bonds for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond tenors) and impact the bank's profitability adversely. Given the importance of AT1 instruments for prudently managing the capital levels and improving the returns for the equity holders, we are of the opinion that banks would choose to service the interest on AT1 bonds and exercise the first call option on AT1 bonds, as they have done in the past. F inally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual instrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the annual call on these instruments would enable the bank to call the bond on any of the subsequent annual call options dates. NBFCs and Corporates While the issuer is not obligated to exercise the call option on first call date, the coupon step -up usually provides financial incentive to the Issuer to exercise the call option.

    "to exercise the call option on first call date, the coupon step -up usually provides financial incentive to the Issuer to exercise the call option. Further, as we invest in issuer with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to be cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to exercising the call as the part of their long term resource raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of first call option exercise can lead to increase in cost of PDI for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond tenors) and impact the issuer's profitability adversely. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual instrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the coupon step up also compensates the investor for extended holding period. While these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would be completely eliminated. II.

The appointment of such intermediaries shall be in accordance with the applicable requirements of SEBI and within the permissible ceilings of expenses as stated under Regulation 52 of SEBI (MF) Regulations. \u2022 Investment in Securitised Debt A securitisation transaction involves sale of receivables by the originator (a bank, non-banking finance company, housing finance company, or a manufacturing/service company) to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), typically set up in the form of a trust. Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs), the proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling 41 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID his loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much before the maturity of the underlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from borrowers. Typically, the transaction is provided with a limited amount of credit enhancement (as stipulated by the rating agency for a target rating), which provides protection to investors against defaults by the underlying borrowers. Generally available asset classes for securitisation in India are: \u25cf Commercial vehicles \u25cf Auto and two wheeler pools \u25cf Mortgage pools (residential housing loans) \u25cf Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans \u25cf Corporate loans/receivables Investment / Risk Mitigation Strategy 1. Risk profile of securitised debt vis-\u00e0-vis risk appetite of the Scheme The risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities",
    "(residential housing loans) \u25cf Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans \u25cf Corporate loans/receivables Investment / Risk Mitigation Strategy 1. Risk profile of securitised debt vis-\u00e0-vis risk appetite of the Scheme The risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities at the same level of credit rating. Securitised debt offers additional income (spread) over a debt security of similar rating and maturity, which enables the scheme to optimize its income without taking any additional credit risk. Securitised debt is generally less liquid, however, investmen t in securitised debt is made to maintain a diversified portfolio of debt securities that optimizes return without increasing the overall risk profile of the Scheme. 2. Policy relating to originators based on nature of originator, track record, NPAs, loss es in earlier securitised debt, etc The originator is an entity (like banks, non-banking finance companies, corporates etc), which has initially provided the loan & is also generally responsible for servicing the loans. The schemes will invest in securitised debt of originators with at least investment grade credit rating and established track record. A detailed evaluation of originator is done before the investment is made in securitised debt of any originator on various parameters given below: \u25cf Track record The investment in securitised debt is done based on origination and underwriting process and capabilities of the originator, overview of corporate structure, group to which they belong, experience of the company in the business & how long they have been in the business, financial condition of the company, credit rating, past performance of similar pools by the originator, etc. \u25cf Willingness to pay through credit enhancement facilities etc. Credit enhancement is provided by the originator, as indicated by rating agencies, so as to adequately cover the defaults and acts as a risk mitigation measure. The size of the credit enhancement as indicated by rating agency depends on the originator's track record, past delinquencies, pattern of the portfolio & characteristics of the pool vis-a-vis of the portfolio, nature of the asset class. \u25cf Ability to pay The quality of the origination impacts the performance of the underlying asset & thus originators with strong systems and processes in place can eliminate poor quality assets. A robust risk management system of the originator and availability of MIS reports on timely basis, results in creation of strong asset portfolio. \u25cf Business",
    "of the origination impacts the performance of the underlying asset & thus originators with strong systems and processes in place can eliminate poor quality assets. A robust risk management system of the originator and availability of MIS reports on timely basis, results in creation of strong asset portfolio. \u25cf Business Risk Assessment The business risk assessment of originator / underlying borrower also includes detailed credit assessment wherein following factors are also considered: - Outlook for the economy (domestic and global) - Outlook for the industry - Company specific factors 42 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID In addition, a detailed review and assessment of rating rationale is done along with interactions with the company as well as the rating agency. All investment in securitised debt is done after taking into account, the Critical Evaluation Parameters (for pool loan and single loan securitisation transactions) regarding the originator / underlying issuer as mentioned below: \u25cf Default track record/ frequent alteration of redemption conditions / covenants \u25cf High leverage ratios of the ultimate borrower (for si ngle-sell downs) - both on a standalone basis as well on a consolidated level/ group level \u25cf Higher proportion of reschedulement of underlying assets of the pool or loan, as the case may be \u25cf Higher proportion of overdue assets of the pool or the underlying loan, as the case may be \u25cf Poor reputation in market \u25cf Insufficient track record of servicing of the pool or the loan, as the case may be. 3. Risk mitigation strategies for investments with each kind of originator Investments are based on assessment o f following parameters, so as to mitigate risk associated with such investment: a. Credit quality, size and reach of the originator b. Nature of receivables/asset category i.e. cars, construction equipment, commercial vehicles, personal loans etc. c. Collection process, infrastructure and follow-up mechanism d. Quality of MIS e. Credit cum liquidity enhancement f. Credit appraisal norms of originator g. Asset Quality - portfolio delinquency levels h. Past performance of rated pools i. Pool Characteristics - seasoning, Loan-to-value ratios, geographic diversity etc. 4. The level of diversification with respect to the underlying assets, and risk mitigation measures for less diversified investments Diversification of underlying assets is achieved through a) prudent mix of asset categories - i.e. cars (new, used), commercial vehicles, construction equipment, unsecured loans to individuals or small & medium enterprises b) total number of contracts in a pool",

Notes: A. In case of securitised debt with underlying being single loan, the investment limit applicable to the underlying borrower is considered. B. Other investment will be decided on a case to case basis. In case of asset backed pools (ABS), evaluation of the pool assets is done considering the following factors: (Refer the table above which illustrates the averages of parameters considered while selecting the pool) \u2022 Size of the loan \u2022 Average original maturity of the pool \u2022 Loan to Value Ratio \u2022 Average seasoning of the pool \u2022 Default rate distribution \u2022 Geographical Distribution \u2022 Credit enhancement facility \u2022 Liquid facility \u2022 Structure of the pool 5.

Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation in the case of asset pools is in the form of seasoning of loans to various asset classes (cars, commerc ial vehicles, etc.) and generally varies from one month to six months depending on the nature of asset. 6. Minimum retention percentage by originator of debts to be securitised While minimum retention percentage by originator is not prescribed, any amount retained by the originator through subordination is viewed positively at the time of making investment and generally varies from 5% to 10%. 7. The mechanism to tackle conflict of interest when the mutual fund invests in securitised debt of an originator and the originator in turn makes investments in that particular scheme of the fund 44 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID All proposals for investment in securitised debt are evaluated by the credit analyst based on several parameters such as nature of underlying asset category, pool characteristics, asset quality, credit rating of the securitisation transaction, and credit cum liquidity enhancement available. Investment in securitised debt in any scheme is made by the respective fund manager in line with the investment objective of that scheme. 8. The resources and mechanism of individual risk assessment with the AMC for monitoring investment in securitised debt (in general) Investment in securitised debt is monitored regularly with regards to its performance on various parameters such as collection efficiency, delinquencies, prepayments and utilization of credit enhancement. Information on these parameters is available through monthly reports from Pool Trustees and through information disseminated by the rating agencies. Monthly performance report is released by the credit analyst to the fund management team and the fund management team periodically reviews the same. Trading in Derivatives \u2022 The Scheme may take derivatives position based on the opportunities available subject to the guidelines provided by SEBI from time to time and in line with the overall investment objective of the Scheme. \u2022 The Scheme intends to use derivatives mainly for the purpose of hedging and portfolio balancing.

Exposure to Derivatives The exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by SEBI vide its clause 12.25 of Master Circular and as amended from time to time are as follows: Position Limits The position limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by clause 12.25 of the Master Circular read with SEBI circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-2/P/CIR/2024/140 dated October 15, 2024 and SEBI circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD-1/P/CIR/2025/79 dated May 29, 2025 are as follows: i. Position limit for Mutual Funds in index options contracts a) The Mutual Fund position limit in all index options contracts at PAN level shall be as follows: i. Net end of day FutEq OI limit for options to be \u20b91,500 cr. and ii. Gross end of day FutEq OI to be \u20b910,000 cr.

Delta denotes sensitivity of price movement of derivative position with respect to that of the underlying. Accordingly, long futures have a delta of +1 times notional. For options, delta will range between 0 and +1 times notional for long calls and between 0 and \u20131 times notional for long puts. In case of short options position, effective delta for short calls is negative and that of short put is positive. ii. Gross addition of such net Future Equivalent Open Interest (FutEq OI) across all the Unique Client Codes would form the FutEq OI for the Stock/Index derivatives. iii. Additional position limit for hedging In addition to the position limits at point (i) and (ii) above, Mutual Funds may take exposure in equity index derivatives subject to the following limits: 1. Aggregate short positions in index derivatives (short futures, short calls and long puts) shall not exceed (FutEq terms for Index options and gross notional terms for Index futures) the Mutual Fund\u2019s holding of stocks. 2.

Position limit for each Scheme of a Mutual Fund The Scheme-wise position limit requirements shall be: 1. The gross open positions across all derivative contracts on a particular underlying s tock should not exceed the higher of: 1% of the free float market capitalization (in terms of number of shares). or 5% of the open interest in the derivative contracts on a particular underlying stock (in terms of number of contracts). 2. These position limits would be applicable on the combined position in all derivative contracts on an underlying stock at a Stock exchange. 3. For index based contracts, Mutual Funds shall disclose the total open interest held by",
    "contracts on a particular underlying stock (in terms of number of contracts). 2. These position limits would be applicable on the combined position in all derivative contracts on an underlying stock at a Stock exchange. 3. For index based contracts, Mutual Funds shall disclose the total open interest held by its Scheme or all Schemes put together in a particular Underlying Index, if such open interest equals to or exceeds 15% of the open interest of all derivative contracts on that Underlying Index. Exposure Limits The exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by clauses 12.24 and 12.25 of Master Circular, are as follows: 1. The cumulative gross exposure through equity, debt, derivative positions (including fixed income derivatives), repo transactions in corporate debt securities, credit default swaps, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), other permitted securities/assets and such other securities/assets as may be permitted by SEBI from time to time shall not exceed 100% of the net assets of the scheme. Security wise hedge positions using 46 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID derivatives such as Interest Rate Swaps, call options written under the covered call Strategy and any other positions specifically exempted under SEBI guidelines from time to time, will not be considered in calculating above exposure. 2. Mutual Funds shall not write options or purchase instruments with em -bedded written options (except for exposure on account of call option written under the covered call strategy, if permitted under the Scheme). 3. The total exposure related to option premium paid must n ot exceed 20% of the net assets of the scheme. 4. Cash or cash equivalents i.e. Government Securities, T-Bills and Repo on Government Securities having residual maturity of less than 91 days may be treated as not creating any exposure. 5. Exposure due to hedging positions may not be included in the above mentioned limits subject to the following: a) Hedging positions are the derivative positions that reduce possible losses on an existing position in securities and till the existing position remains. b) Hedging positions cannot be taken for existing derivative positions. Exposure due to such positions shall have to be added and treated under limits mentioned in Point 1. c) Any derivative instrument used to hedge has the same underlying security as the exist ing position being hedged. d) The quantity of underlying associated with the derivative position taken for hedging purposes",
    "due to such positions shall have to be added and treated under limits mentioned in Point 1. c) Any derivative instrument used to hedge has the same underlying security as the exist ing position being hedged. d) The quantity of underlying associated with the derivative position taken for hedging purposes does not exceed the quantity of the existing position against which hedge has been taken. 6. (a) Mutual Funds may enter into plain vanilla Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) for hedging purposes. The value of the notional principal in such cases must not exceed the value of respective existing assets being hedged by the scheme. (b) In case of participation in IRS is through over the counter transactions, the counter party has to be an entity recognized as a market maker by RBI and exposure to a single counterparty in such transactions should not exceed 10% of the net assets of the scheme. However, if mutual funds are transacting in IRS through an e lectronic trading platform offered by the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL) and CCIL is the central counterparty for such transactions guaranteeing settlement, the single counterparty limit of 10% shall not be applicable. 7. Exposure due to derivati ve positions taken for hedging purposes in excess of the underlying position against which the hedging position has been taken, shall be treated under the limits mentioned in point 1. 8. Definition of Exposure in case of Derivative Positions Each position taken in derivatives shall have an associated exposure as defined under. Exposure is the maximum possible loss that may occur on a position. However, certain derivative positions may theoretically have unlimited possible loss. Exposure in derivative positions shall be computed as follows: Position Exposure 47 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID Long Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts Short Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts Option Bought Option Premium Paid * Lot Size * Number of Contracts Exposure limits on Credit Default Swaps (CDS) Exposure through CDS (Notional amount of both CDS bought and sold) shall not exceed 10% of AUM of scheme and shall be within the overall limit of derivatives.

    "scheme and shall be within the overall limit of derivatives. Exposure limits on Interest Rate Futures (IRF) The exposure limits for trading in Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) by Mutual Funds specified by clause 12.25.9 of Master Circular are as follows: i. To reduce interest rate risk in a debt portfolio, mutual funds may hedge the portfolio or part of the portfolio (including one or more securities) on weighted average modified duration basis by using Interest Rate Futures (IRFs). The maximum extent of short position that may be taken in IRFs to hedge interest rate risk of the portfolio or part of the portfolio, is as per the formula given below: (Portfolio Modified Duration* Market Value of the Portfolio) (Futures Modified Duration *Futures Price/PAR) ii. In case the IRF used for hedging the interest rate risk has different underlying security(s) than the existing position being hedged, it would result in imperfect hedging. iii. Imperfect hedging using IRFs may be considered to be exempted from the gross exposure, upto maximum of 20% of the net assets of the scheme, subject to the following: a) Exposure to IRFs is created only for hedging the interest rate risk based on the weighted average modified duration of the bond portfolio or part of the portfolio. b) Mutual Funds are permitted to resort to imperfect hedging, without it being considered under the gross exposure limits, if and only if, the correlation between the portfolio or part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged portions, if any) and the IRF is atleast 0.9 at the time of initiation of hedge. In case of any subsequent deviation from the correlation c riteria, the same may be rebalanced within 5 working days and if not rebalanced within the timeline, the derivative positions created for hedging shall be considered under the gross exposure computed in terms of clause 12.24.1 of Master Circular. The correlation should be calculated for a period of last 90 days. Explanation: If the fund manager intends to do imperfect hedging upto 15% of the portfolio using IRFs on weighted average modified duration basis, either of the following conditions need to be complied with: i. The correlation for past 90 days between the portfolio and the IRF is at least 0.9 or ii. The correlation for past 90 days between the part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged portions, if any) i.e. at least 15% of the net",

    "international debt markets is very wide. In terms of diverse instruments as well as liquidity, overseas debt markets offer great depth and are extremely well developed. Investment in international debt greatly expands the universe of top quality debt, which is no longer restricted to the limited papers available in the domestic debt market. The higher rated overseas sovereign, quasi - government and corporate debt offer lower default risk in addition to offering a high degree of liquidity since these are traded across major international markets. Investments in rated international debt offer multiple benefits of risk reduction, a much wider universe of top quality debt and also potential gains from currency movements. Investments in international markets are most often in U.S. dollars, though the Euro, Pound Sterling and the Yen are also major currencies. Though this market is geographically well spread across global financial centres, the markets in the U.S., European Union and Lo ndon offer the most liquidity and depth of instruments. Besides factors specific to the country / issuer, international bond prices are influenced to a large extent by a number of other factors; chief among these are the international economic outlook, cha nges in interest rates in major economies, trading volumes in overseas markets, cross currency movements among major currencies, rating changes of countries / corporations and major political changes globally.

Operational issues; or 4. If so directed by SEBI. It is clarified that since the occurrence of the abovementioned eventualities have the ability to impact the overall market and liquidity situation, the same may result in exceptionally large number of Redemption requests being made and in such a situation the indicative timelines, if any mentioned by the Fund in the scheme offering documents, for processing of requests for Redemption may not be applicable. Any restriction on Redemption or suspension of Redemption of the Units in the Scheme(s) of the Mutual Fund shall be made applicable only after specific approval of the Board of Directors of the AMC and Trustee Company and thereafter, immediately informing the same to SEBI.

    "and where the funds for the entire amount are available for utilization before the cut- off time i.e. credited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut- off time - the closing NAV of the day shall be applicable. \u25cf In respect of valid applications received after 3.00 p.m. and where the funds for the entire amount are credited to the bank account of the Scheme either at any time on the same day or before the cut-off time of the next Business Day i.e. available for utilization before the cut-off time of the next Business Day - the closing NAV of the next Business Day shall be applicable. \u25cf Irrespective of the time of receipt of application, where the funds for the entire amount are credited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time on any subsequent Business Day i.e. available for utilization before the cut-off time on any subsequent Business Day - the closing NAV of such subsequent Business Day shall be applicable. 63 HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID B] For Switch-ins of any amount: For determining the applicable NAV, the following shall be ensured: \u25cf Application for switch-in is received before the applicable cut-off time. \u25cf Funds for the entire amount of subscription/purchase as per the switch-in request are credited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time. \u25cf The funds are available for utilization before the cut-off time. \u25cf In case of \u2018switch\u2019 transactions from one scheme to another, the allocation shall be in line with redemption payouts.

Since different payment modes have different settlement cycles including electronic transactions (as per arrangements with Payment Aggregators / Banks / Exchanges etc), it may happen that the investor's account is debited, but the money is not credited within cut-off time on the same date to the Scheme's bank account, leading to a gap / delay in Unit allotment. Investors are therefore urged to use the most efficient electronic payment modes to avoid delays in realization of funds and consequently in Unit allotment.

The Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF) Regulations. As part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivati ve instruments such as futures and options, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible in future under applicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for restricted purposes as permitted by the regulations. For detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI. For exposure limits to derivatives, refer section \u2018Where will the scheme invest\u2019 under Section II, Part II, Clause A in the SID. 6 HDFC Mid Cap Fund - KIM Though every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the AMC/Sponsor/Trustee do",

For exposure limits to derivatives, refer section \u2018Where will the scheme invest\u2019 under Section II, Part II, Clause A in the SID. 6 HDFC Mid Cap Fund - KIM Though every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the AMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved. No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme. 8. Risk Profile of the Scheme Mutual Fund Units involve investment risks including the possible loss of principal. Please read the details on risk factors carefully before investment. Scheme specific Risk Factors are summarized below: Scheme Specific Risk Factors: While Small & Mid -cap stocks gives one an opportunity to go beyond the usual large blue chip stocks and present possible higher capital appreciation, it is important to note that Small & Mid-cap stocks can be riskier and more volatile on a relative basis. Therefore, the risk levels of inve sting in Small & Midcap stocks are more than investing in stocks of large well established companies. It should be noted that over a period of time, small -cap, mid -cap and large -cap stocks have demonstrated different levels of volatility and investment ret urns. And it is important to note that generally, no one class consistently outperforms the others. (i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments \u2022 Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks. \u2022 Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk. \u2022 While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u2022 Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances.",
    "overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u2022 Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances. (ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities \u2022 The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme is expected to increase fro m a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates. \u2022 Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and m ay lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. 7 HDFC Mid Cap Fund - KIM \u2022 Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of the issuers. \u2022 Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis. \u2022 Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities before their maturity date, in periods of declining inter est rates. The possibility of such prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme. \u2022 Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be",
    "Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed. \u2022 Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subs equent decline in the value of securities held in the Scheme's portfolio. \u2022 Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price -risk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price -risk is not unique to Government Securities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Sec urities are unique in the sense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by movement in interest rates in the financial system. \u2022 Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. F urther even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated bonds. \u2022 The AMC may,",
    "and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. F urther even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated bonds. \u2022 The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero cou pon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio. \u2022 As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The 8 HDFC Mid Cap Fund - KIM AMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interes t prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securiti es begin paying current interest. It also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically. (iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: \u2022 Except for any security of an associate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a stock exchange (\u201cunli sted Securities\u201d) which in general are subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value. \u2022 Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer -specific developments. Such investments display increased price sensitivity to changing",
    "that the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value. \u2022 Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer -specific developments. Such investments display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities. (iv) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated securities The risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to the risk factors associated with debt instruments. \u2022 Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and could include guarantee, shortfall u ndertaking, letter of comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity could be either related or non-related to the issuer like a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on st ock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evalua tion of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the issuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan pools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer. \u2022 Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit enhancements. Debt securities lack a well -developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold. \u2022 Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer",
    "instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold. \u2022 Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The 9 HDFC Mid Cap Fund - KIM weakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, apart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit risk. (v) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri -party Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments. T he members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL). As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's contribution if th ere is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non -defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement ob ligations. In addition, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member). CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members",
    "is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member). CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contri bution to the default fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund. (vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities \u25cf Currency Risk: Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian Rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co -related, can differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to their interest rate cycles. \u25cf Credit Risk: 10 HDFC Mid Cap Fund - KIM Investment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with rating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency. \u25cf Taxation Risk: In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI) under section \u201cSpecial Consideration\u201d, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges based on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation. The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its investment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing / evolving",
    "The scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation. The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its investment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing / evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All these may entail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk: Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject could differ materially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively. \u25cf Country Risk: The Country risk arises from the ina bility of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would includ e events such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi - lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of trades or otherwise. \u25cf To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time. \u2022 Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities: In case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by regulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in permissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity. (vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives \u2022 The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and",
    "(vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives \u2022 The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative re quires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks 11 HDFC Mid Cap Fund - KIM include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices. \u2022 Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund manager to identify such opportunities. Identificati on and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies. \u2022 The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. \u2022 Credit Risk: The credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. \u2022 Market Risk: Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. \u2022 Illiquidity risk: This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of liquidity in the market. Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate Futures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. (viii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares \u2022 Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the",
    "from the hedge position entered using the IRF. (viii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares \u2022 Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non-cumulative preference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on preference shares in case of inadequate profits in any year. \u2022 Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity. \u2022 Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus, there is significant risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation. (ix) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending As with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited b y the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The 12 HDFC Mid Cap Fund - KIM scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss of opportunity. (x) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt The Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive. \u2022 Limited Liquidity & Price Risk There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the ability of the investor to resell them. \u2022 Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk The Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the ori ginator,",
    "to resell them. \u2022 Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk The Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the ori ginator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors' Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available u nder the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However, many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required to realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may be lower than the amount due from that Obligor. \u2022 Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs). \u2022 Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could experience losses or delays in the payments. \u2022 Risk of Co-mingling With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing the same into the Collection account especi ally considering that some of the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to a potential loss. (xi) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI) Perpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital",
    "be exposed to a potential loss. (xi) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI) Perpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital Regulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory guidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue thes e bonds 13 HDFC Mid Cap Fund - KIM as per guidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below: Key Risk Factors: - Risk on coupon servicing Banks As per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow banks to make payment of coupons. NBFCs While NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can also be deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios. Corporates Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI. - Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks As per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET-1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT -1 bonds can get written down. Further, AT -1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non -viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT -1 Bonds or a pub lic sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. - Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer Banks The issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period from the date",
    "has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. - Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer Banks The issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period from the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not exercise the call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. NBFCs The NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. Corporates 14 HDFC Mid Cap Fund - KIM There is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exe rcise the call option, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date. (xii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling Short-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock back for less than he received fo r selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theo retically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio. (xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs: \u25cf Price Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: Securities/Instruments of",
    "daily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. \u25cf Credit Risk: Credit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled. \u25cf Liquidity Risk: This refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for which a liquid m arket exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk. \u25cf Reinvestment Risk: Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be repatriation of funds by th e Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay -outs, etc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs an d InvITs comprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and 15 HDFC Mid Cap Fund - KIM enforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations or standards or fut ure amendments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions. (xiv) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities In repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with the seller agreeing to",
    "impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions. (xiv) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities In repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with the seller agreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater than the original sale price, the difference effectively represent ing interest. A repo in corporate debt securities is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporate debt securities as collateral to protect against default. Some of the risks associated with repo in corporate debt are given below: Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy back securities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In case of over the counter (OTC) repo trades, the investment manager will endeavo ur to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with counterparties having strong credit profiles. Also, the counter -party risk is to an extent mitigated by taking collateral equivalent in value to the transaction after knocking off a minimum haircut on the intrinsic value of the collateral. In the event of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate debt securities. In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may also provide settlement guarantee. Collateral Risk : Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to meet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for replacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basi s by considering the daily market",
    "security than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basi s by considering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The fund manager or the exchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a prespecified period. If the counterparty is not able to top -up either in form of cash / collateral, it would tantamount to early termination of the repo agreement, and the outstanding amount can be recovered by sale of collateral. (xv) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes 1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes. 2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads. (xvi) General Risk factors 16 HDFC Mid Cap Fund - KIM \u2022 Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down bec ause of various factors that affect the capital markets in general. \u2022 As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under cer tain circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend Redemption of the units. \u2022 At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest in securities falling within it s investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest",
    "or Suspend Redemption of the units. \u2022 At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest in securities falling within it s investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day -to-day liquidity requirements. \u2022 Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark part icularly over a short to medium term period. \u2022 Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies. \u2022 The Scheme at times m ay receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset - liability mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments.

The Scheme may also invest a certain portion of its corpus in debt and money market securities. Investment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their outlook. The Scheme may also invest in the hybrid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for diversification and subject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time. Subject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may, engage in Stock Lending activities. The Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF) Regulations. As part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as futures and options, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible in future under applicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for restricted purposes as permitted by the regulations. For detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI. For exposure limits to derivatives, refer section \u2018Where will the scheme invest\u2019 under Section II, Part II, Clause A. Though every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the AMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved. No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme. Risk Control Investments made by the Scheme would be in accordance with the investment objectives of the scheme and provisions of SEBI (MF) Regulations. Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would incorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio construction process. The risk control process involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this diversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use various derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time, with an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest. While these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would be completely eliminated.

    "there can be no assurance that these risks would be completely eliminated. PORTFOLIO TURNOVER The Scheme is an open -ended Scheme. The portfolio is managed from a long term perspective with an endeavour to ke ep portfolio turnover ratio low. However, it is expected that there would be a number of subscriptions and redemptions on a daily basis. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable measure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage and transaction cost. 14 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID D. HOW WILL THE SCHEME BENCHMARK ITS PERFORMANCE?

(This is the price you will receive for redemptions/ switch-outs): The Repurchase Price for a valid repurchase will be the applicable NAV reduced by any exit load (say 1%). i.e. applicable NAV - (applicable NAV X applicable exit load). For a valid repurchase request where the applicable NAV is Rs. 12.123, the repurchase price will be: = 12.123 - (12.123 X 1.00%) = 12.123 - 0.121 = Rs. 12.022 Therefore, for a repurchase of 899.038 units, the proceeds received by the investor will be - = 899.038 (units) * 12.022 (Repurchase price) = Rs. 10,790.02 (rounded to two decimals) Charges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above illustration. While determining the price of the units, the mutual fund shall ensure that the repurchase price of an open ended scheme is not lower than 97 per cent of the Net Asset Value.

DEFINITIONS / INTERPRETATION Visit: https://www.hdfcfund.com/statutory-disclosure/offer-document-disclosures B. RISK FACTORS \u25a0 Scheme Specific Risk Factors: Some of the specific risk factors related to the Scheme include, but are not limited to the following: Scheme Specific Risk Factors: While Small & Mid-cap stocks gives one an opportunity to go beyond the usual large blue chip stocks and present possible higher capital appreciation, it is important to note that Small & Mid -cap stocks can be riskier and more volatile on a relative basis. Therefore, the risk levels of investing in Small & Midcap stocks are more than investing in stocks of large well established companies. It should be noted that over a period of time, small-cap, mid-cap and large-cap stocks have demonstrated different levels of volatility and investment returns. And it is important to note that generally, no one class consistently outperforms the others. (i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments \u2022 Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related i nstruments involve a degree of risk and investors should",
    "outperforms the others. (i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments \u2022 Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related i nstruments involve a degree of risk and investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks. \u2022 Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk. \u2022 While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u2022 Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances. (ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities \u2022 The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates. \u2022 Money market in struments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u2022 Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of the issuers. \u2022 Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which 27 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are fac tors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and",
    "have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are fac tors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis. \u2022 Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme. \u2022 Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed. \u2022 Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in the Scheme's portfolio. \u2022 Government securities where a fixed return is offere d run price -risk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels",
    "extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government Securities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the sense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by movement in interest rates in the financial system. \u2022 Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated bonds. \u2022 The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio. \u2022 As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically. (iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted",
    "interest. It also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically. (iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: 28 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID \u2022 Except for any security of an associate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a stock exchange (\u201cunlisted Securities\u201d) which in general are subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value. \u2022 Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer -specific developments. Such investments display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities. (iv) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated securities The risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to the risk factors associated with debt instruments. \u2022 Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and could include guarantee, shortfall un dertaking, letter of comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity could be either related or non -related to the issuer like a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluat ion of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the issuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan pools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer. \u2022 Liquidity Risk: SO ra ted securities",
    "rated instruments evaluat ion of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the issuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan pools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer. \u2022 Liquidity Risk: SO ra ted securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit enhancements. Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the l iquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold. \u2022 Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce guaran tee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, apart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit risk. (v) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri-party Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL). 29 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default",
    "maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL). 29 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's contribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non - defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligati ons. In addition, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member). CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund. (vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities \u25cf Currency Risk: Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian Rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related, can differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to their interest rate cycles. \u25cf Credit Risk: Investment in Foreign Debt Sec urities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is substantially reduced since",
    "the Scheme stand exposed to their interest rate cycles. \u25cf Credit Risk: Investment in Foreign Debt Sec urities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with rating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency. \u25cf Taxation Risk: In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI) under section \u201c Special Consideration\u201d, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges based on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation. The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its investment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing / evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where th e Scheme invests. All these may entail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk: Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be su bject could differ materially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively. 30 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID \u25cf Country Risk: The Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisd iction for execution of trades or otherwise. \u25cf To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in",
    "leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisd iction for execution of trades or otherwise. \u25cf To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time. \u2022 Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities: In case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by regulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in permissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity. (vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives \u2022 The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices. \u2022 Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies. \u2022 The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. \u2022 Credit Risk: The credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. \u2022 Market Risk: Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. \u2022 Illiquidity risk: This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack",
    "as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. \u2022 Market Risk: Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. \u2022 Illiquidity risk: This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of liquidity in the market. Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Int erest Rate Futures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. (viii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares \u2022 Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non -cumulative 31 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID preference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on pr eference shares in case of inadequate profits in any year. \u2022 Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity. \u2022 Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus, there is significant risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation. (ix) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending As with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss of opportunity. (x) Risk factors associated with investing",
    "by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss of opportunity. (x) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt The Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive. \u2022 Limited Liquidity & Price Risk There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the ability of the investor to resell them. \u2022 Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk The Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors' Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However, many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required to realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may be lower than the amount due from that Obligor. \u2022 Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs). \u2022 Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could experience losses or delays in the payments. \u2022 Risk of Co-mingling 32 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a",
    "then an investor could experience losses or delays in the payments. \u2022 Risk of Co-mingling 32 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing the same into the Collection account especi ally considering that some of the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to a potential loss. (xi) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI) Perpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital Regulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory guidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue the se bonds as per guidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below: Key Risk Factors: - Risk on coupon servicing Banks As per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow banks to make payment of coupons. NBFCs While NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can also be deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios. Corporates Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI. - Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks As per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET- 1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written down. Further, AT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converte d to common equity, at the discretion",
    "Banks As per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET- 1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written down. Further, AT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converte d to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. - Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer Banks The issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period from the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not exercise the call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the in struments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. 33 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID NBFCs The NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. Corporates There is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call option, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date. (xii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling Short-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money and",

Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow th eoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio. (xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs: \u25cf Price Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure se ctors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. \u25cf Credit Risk: Credit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled. \u25cf Liquidity Risk: This refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for which a liquid m arket exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk. \u25cf Reinvestment Risk: Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be repatriation of funds by th e Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay -outs, etc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how",
    "in assets providing lower returns. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations 34 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID or standards or fut ure amendments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions. (xiv) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities In repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with the seller agreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater than the original sale price, the difference effectively representing interest. A repo in corporate debt securities is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporate debt securities as collateral to protect against default. Some of the risks associated with repo in corporate debt are given below: Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy back securities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In case of over the counter (OTC) repo trades, the investment manager will endeavour to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with counterparties having strong credit profiles. Also, the counter-party risk is to an extent mitigated by taking collateral equivalent in value to the transaction after knocking off a minimum haircut on the intrinsic value of the collateral. In the event of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate debt securities. In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may also provide settlement guarantee. Collateral Risk: Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to meet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can",
    "risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an earl y termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for replacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security than req uired as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by co nsidering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The fund manager or the exchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a prespecified period. If the counterparty is not able to top-up either in form of cash / collateral, it would tantamount to early termination of the repo agreement, and the outstanding amount can be recovered by sale of collateral. (xv) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes 1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes. 2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads. (xvi) General Risk factors \u2022 Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down bec ause of various factors that affect the capital markets in general. \u2022 As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units m ay be significant in 35 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID the event of an inordinately large number of",
    "As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units m ay be significant in 35 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under certain circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend Redemption of the units. \u2022 At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest in securities falling within it s investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity requirements. \u2022 Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to medium term period. \u2022 Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies. \u2022 The Scheme at times m ay receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset -liability mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments. C. RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES Risk Mitigation measures for investments in equity / equity related and debt instruments \u2022 The Scheme\u2019s portfolio comprises equity holdings mainly mid cap stocks (at least 65% of the portfolio). The portfolio can also comprise small-cap and large-cap stocks upto 35% of the portfolio. This flexibility of investing in largecap stocks shall aid in managing volatility and also aid reasonable liquidity. \u2022 Within its investment universe, the Scheme aims to maintain a well-diversified equity portfolio comprising stocks across various sectors of the economy. This shall aid in managing concentration risk and sector specific risks. \u2022 Any investments in debt securities would be undertaken after assessing the associated credit risk, interest rate risk and",
    "its investment universe, the Scheme aims to maintain a well-diversified equity portfolio comprising stocks across various sectors of the economy. This shall aid in managing concentration risk and sector specific risks. \u2022 Any investments in debt securities would be undertaken after assessing the associated credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Credit Evaluation Policy The credit evaluation policy of the AMC entails evaluation of credit fundamentals of each investment opportunity. Some of the factors that are evaluated inter -alia may include outlook on the sector, parentage, quality of management, and overall financial s trength of the credit. The AMC utilises ratings of recognized rating agencies as an input in the credit evaluation process. Investments in bonds and debenture are usually in instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by a recognized rating agency. In line with clause 12.12 of Master Circular, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals for investments in unrated instruments. The AMC Board and the Trustee shall approve the detailed parameters for such investments. The details of such investments would be communicated by the AMC to the Trustee in their periodical reports. It would also be clearly mentioned in the reports, how the parameters have been complied with. However, in case any security does not fall under the parameters, the prior approval of Board of AMC and Trustee shall be sought. Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to sell / liquidate a security at short notice at prevailing market prices or without incurring impact cost. While governme nt bonds, money market instruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easier to sell, corporate bonds and other instruments typically face higher liquidity risk. Further, higher rated securities normally are more liquid compared to lower rated securities. As a result, different portfolios will face different levels of liquidity risk based on the underlying portfolio composition. Some of the strategies to reduce liquidity risk are creating 36 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID portfolios that are diversified across maturities, rating s, types of securities, etc. in line with the fund objectives, regulations and investment strategy. Credit Risk: Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence, credit risk faced by different schemes will be d ifferent based on the underlying portfolio / investment strategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will",
    "strategy. Credit Risk: Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence, credit risk faced by different schemes will be d ifferent based on the underlying portfolio / investment strategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and quali tative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Each of the scheme/portfolio will endeavour to maintain adequate diversification across issuers / sectors in line with scheme objectives, regulations and investment strategy. Unrated investments, if any, woul d require specific approval from a committee constituted for the purpose. Debt Derivatives Risk: The AMC has provision for using derivative instruments for portfolio balancing and hedging purposes. Interest Rate Swaps will be done with approved counter p arties under pre approved ISDA agreements. Mark to Market of swaps, netting off of cash flow and default provision clauses will be provided as per standard practice on a reciprocal basis. Interest Rate Swaps and other derivative instruments will be used as per local (RBI and SEBI) regulatory guidelines. Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk of change in the NAVs due to change in overall market yields. The change in value of a security, for a given change in yield, is higher for a security wit h higher duration and vice versa. Hence portfolios with higher duration will have higher volatility. The AMC shall strive to actively manage the duration of the respective funds based on the prevailing market conditions / outlook of interest rates, keeping in mind the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable regulations. Concentration Risk: The AMC will attempt to mitigate this risk by maintaining adequate diversification across issuers/ sectors / instrument type in line with the scheme obje ctives, investment strategy and applicable regulations. This will also be managed by keeping prudent investment limits on any particular industry or issuer or issuer group based on the size, credit profile, etc. to reduce issuer or industry specific risk. Risk Mitigation measures for investments in Non-Convertible Preference Shares: Credit Risk - To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in -depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.).

    "To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in -depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Liquidity Risk - The Fund endeavours to invest in preference shares of those companies which have relatively better market acceptability amongst market participants that increases the probability of secondary sale in case an exit from the investment is required. Unsecured in nature - The Fund endeavours to mitigate this risk by exercising due diligence while assessing the business, financial and management risks of the company before investing. Risk Mitigation factors relating to investment in Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI): \u2022 Risk on coupon servicing and Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks: The risks on coupon servicing or principal write down/ conversion to equity are mitigated, to a certain extent, if the investee bank has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory guidelines. Hence, an in -depth credit evaluation of each ba nk is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed. 37 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID Investment is done only in the AT -1 bonds of banks with strong credit worthiness, in our assessment. This, in turn, reduces the risk of its capital position falling below regulatory requirements and / or reaching PONV. Risk of write-down or conversion into equity is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. \u2022 Risk on coupon servicing NBFCs These risks are mitigated, to certain extent, if the investee NBFC has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory guidelines. Hence, an in-depth credit evaluation of each NBFC is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed. Corporates To mitigate this risk, an in -depth credit evaluation of each corporate is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, industry position, market share e tc.) and qualitative factors (parentage,",
    "surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed. Corporates To mitigate this risk, an in -depth credit evaluation of each corporate is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, industry position, market share e tc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Additionally, given that the coupon is usually cumulative in nature and the corporate is restricted from paying any dividends till all previous dues are paid to the perpetual bond investor, the company has adequate incentive to not defer coupon on PDIs. \u2022 Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer Banks While the issuer bank does have an option to not exercise the first call, experience suggests that all Indian banks till now have exercised the call option during the call period. We believe that banks are cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to risk of not exercising the call option at the first call date. Further, as we invest in issuers with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to understand the importance of exercising the call as the part of their long term capital raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of call option exercise can lead to increase in cost of AT1 bonds for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond tenors) and impact the bank's profitability adversely. Given the importance of AT1 instruments for prudently managing the capital levels and improving the returns for the equity holders, we are of the opinion that banks would choose to service the interest on AT1 bonds and exercise the first call option on AT1 bonds, as they have done in the past. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual instrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the annual call on these instruments would enable the bank to call the bond on any of the subsequent annual call options dates. NBFCs and Corporates While the issuer is not obligated to exercise the call option on first call date, the coupon step -up usually provides financial incentive to the Issuer to exercise the call option. Further, as we invest in issuer with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to be cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to exercising the call as the part of their long term resource raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of first call",
    "the Issuer to exercise the call option. Further, as we invest in issuer with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to be cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to exercising the call as the part of their long term resource raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of first call option exercise can lead to increase in cost of PDI for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond tenors) and impact the issuer's profitability adversely. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual instrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the coupon step up also compensates the investor for extended holding period. While these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would be completely eliminated. II.

The appointment of such intermediaries shall be in accordance with the applicable requirements of SEBI and within the permissible ceilings of expenses as stated under Regulation 52 of SEBI (MF) Regulations. \u2022 Investment in Securitised Debt A securitisation transaction involves sale of receivables by the originator (a bank, non -banking finance company, housing finance company, or a manufacturing/service company) to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), typically set up in the form of a trust. Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs), the proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling his loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much before the maturity of the underlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from borrowers. Typically, the transaction is provided with a limited amount of credit enhancement (as stipulated by the rating agency for a target rating), which provides protection to investors against defaults by the underlying borrowers. Generally available asset classes for securitisation in India are: 41 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID \u25cf Commercial vehicles \u25cf Auto and two wheeler pools \u25cf Mortgage pools (residential housing loans) \u25cf Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans \u25cf Corporate loans/receivables Investment / Risk Mitigation Strategy 1.

    "Risk Mitigation Strategy 1. Risk profile of securitised debt vis-\u00e0-vis risk appetite of the Scheme The risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities at the same level of credit rating. Securitised debt offers additional income (spread) over a debt security of similar rating and maturity, which enables the scheme to optimize its income without taking any additional credit risk. Securitised debt is generally less liquid, however, investment in securitised debt is made to maintain a diversified portfolio of debt securities that optimizes return without increasing the overall risk profile of the Scheme. 2. Policy relating to originators based on nature of originator, track record, NPAs, losses in earlier securitised debt, etc The originator is an entity (like banks, non-banking finance companies, corporates etc), which has initially provided the loan & is also generally responsible for servicing the loans. The schemes will invest in securitised debt of originators with at least investment grade credit rating and established track record. A detailed evaluation of originator is done before the investment is made in securitised debt of any originator on various parameters given below: \u25cf Track record The investment in securitised debt is done based on origination and underwriting process and capabilities of the originator, overview of corporate structure, group to which they belong, experience of the company in the business & how long they have been in the business, financial condition of the company, credit rating, past performance of similar pools by the originator, etc. \u25cf Willingness to pay through credit enhancement facilities etc. Credit enhancement is provided by the originator, as indicated by rating agencies, so as to adequately cover the defaults and acts as a risk mitigation measure. The size of the credit enhancement as indicated by rating agency depends on the originator's track record, past delinquencies, pattern of the portfolio & characteristics of the pool vis-a-vis of the portfolio, nature of the asset class. \u25cf Ability to pay The quality of the origination impacts the performance of the underlying asset & thus originators with strong systems and processes in place can eliminate poor quality assets. A robust risk management system of the originator and availability of MIS reports on timely basis, resu lts in creation of strong asset portfolio. \u25cf Business Risk Assessment The business risk assessment of originator / underlying borrower also includes detailed credit assessment wherein following",
    "place can eliminate poor quality assets. A robust risk management system of the originator and availability of MIS reports on timely basis, resu lts in creation of strong asset portfolio. \u25cf Business Risk Assessment The business risk assessment of originator / underlying borrower also includes detailed credit assessment wherein following factors are also considered: - Outlook for the economy (domestic and global) - Outlook for the industry - Company specific factors In addition, a detailed review and assessment of rating rationale is done along with interactions with the company as well as the rating agency. All investment in securitised debt is done after taking into account, the Critical Evaluation Parameters (for pool loan and single loan securitisation transactions) regarding the originator / underlying issuer as mentioned below: \u25cf Default track record/ frequent alteration of redemption conditions / covenants 42 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID \u25cf High leverage ratios of the ultimate borrower (for single -sell downs) - both on a standalone basis as well on a consolidated level/ group level \u25cf Higher proportion of reschedulement of underlying assets of the pool or loan, as the case may be \u25cf Higher proportion of overdue assets of the pool or the underlying loan, as the case may be \u25cf Poor reputation in market \u25cf Insufficient track record of servicing of the pool or the loan, as the case may be. 3. Risk mitigation strategies for investments with each kind of originator Investments are based on assessment of following parameters, so as to mitigate risk associated with such investment: a. Credit quality, size and reach of the originator b. Nature of receivables/asset category i.e. cars, construction equipment, commercial vehicles, personal loans etc. c. Collection process, infrastructure and follow-up mechanism d. Quality of MIS e. Credit cum liquidity enhancement f. Credit appraisal norms of originator g. Asset Quality - portfolio delinquency levels h. Past performance of rated pools i. Pool Characteristics - seasoning, Loan-to-value ratios, geographic diversity etc. 4. The level of diversification with respect to the underlying assets, and risk mitigation measures for less diversified investments Diversification of underlying assets is achieved through a) prudent mix of asset categories - i.e. cars (new, used), commercial vehicles, construction equipment, unsecured loans to individuals or small & medium enterprises b) to tal number of contracts in a pool c) average ticket size of loans and d) geographical distribution.

Notes: A. In case of securitised debt with underlying being single loan, the investment limit applicable to the underlying borrower is considered. B. Other investment will be decided on a case to case basis. In case of asset backed pools (ABS), evaluation of the pool assets is done considering the following factors: (Refer the table above which illustrates the averages of parameters considered while selecting the pool) \u2022 Size of the loan \u2022 Average original maturity of the pool \u2022 Loan to Value Ratio \u2022 Average seasoning of the pool \u2022 Default rate distribution \u2022 Geographical Distribution \u2022 Credit enhancement facility \u2022 Liquid facility \u2022 Structure of the pool 5. Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation The illustrative average seasoning of the debt by originator prior to securitisation is given above in table (Refer Point 4).

Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation in the case of asset pools is in the form of seasoning of loans to various asset classes (cars, commer cial vehicles, etc.) and generally varies from one month to six months depending on the nature of asset. 6. Minimum retention percentage by originator of debts to be securitised While minimum retention percentage by originator is not prescribed, any amount retained by the originator through subordination is viewed positively at the time of making investment and generally varies from 5% to 10%. 7. The mechanism to tackle conflict of interest when the mutual fund invests in securitised debt of an originator and the originator in turn makes investments in that particular scheme of the fund All proposals for investment in securitised debt are evaluated by the credit analyst based on several parameters such as nature of underlying asset category, pool char acteristics, asset quality, credit rating of the securitisation transaction, and credit cum liquidity enhancement available. Investment in securitised debt in any scheme is made by the respective fund manager in line with the investment objective of that scheme. 44 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID 8. The resources and mechanism of individual risk assessment with the AMC for monitoring investment in securitised debt (in general) Investment in securitised debt is monitored regularly with regards to its performance on various parameters suc h as collection efficiency, delinquencies, prepayments and utilization of credit enhancement. Information on these parameters is available through monthly reports from Pool Trustees and through information disseminated by the rating agencies. Monthly performance report is released by the credit analyst to the fund management team and the fund management team periodically reviews the same. Trading in Derivatives \u2022 The Scheme may take derivatives position based on the opportunities available subject to the guidelines provided by SEBI from time to time and in line with the overall investment objective of the Scheme. \u2022 The Scheme intends to use derivatives mainly for the purpose of hedging and portfolio balancing. Losses may arise as a result of using derivatives, but these are likely to be compensated by the gains on the underlying cash instruments held by the Scheme. \u2022 The Scheme may take position in derivative instruments like Futures, Options, and such other derivative instruments as may be permitted by",

Position limit for Mutual Funds in index futures contracts a) The Mutual Fund position limit in all index futures contracts on a particular Underlying Index shall be higher of 15% of futures OI for that index or \u20b9500 cr. b) This limit would be applicable on open positions in all futures contracts on a particular Underlying Index. c) The above stated position limits for index futures would be measured on gross notional basis. The position limits shall be computed on a gross basis at the level of MF and on a net basis at the level of schemes of MF. Formulation of Open Interest (OI) i. OI in derivatives shall be measured at portfolio level by computing the net Delta adjusted open positions across futu res and options for an underlying at a given point in time. Delta denotes sensitivity of price movement of derivative position with respect to that of the underlying. Accordingly, long futures have a delta of +1 times notional. For options, delta will range between 45 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID 0 and +1 times notional for long calls and",

Additional position limit for hedging In addition to the position limits at point (i) and (ii) above, Mutual Funds may take exposure in equity index derivatives subject to the following limits: 1. Aggregate short positions in index derivatives (short futures, short calls and long puts) shall not exceed (FutEq terms for Index options and gross notional terms for Index futures) the Mutual Fund\u2019s holding of stocks. 2. Aggregate long positions in index derivatives (long futures, long calls and short puts) shall not exceed (FutEq terms for Index options and gross noti onal terms for Index futures) the Mutual Fund\u2019s holding of cash and cash equivalent, government securities, T -Bills and similar instruments. iv.

Cash or cash equivalents i.e. Government Securities, T -Bills and Repo on Government Securities having residual maturity of less than 91 days may be treated as not creating any exposure. 5. Exposure due to hedging positions may not be included in the above mentioned limits subject to the following: a) Hedging positions are the derivative positions that reduce possible losses on an existing position in securities and till the existing position remains. b) Hedging positions cannot be taken for existing derivative positions. Exposure due to such positions shall have to be added and treated under limits mentioned in Point 1. c) Any derivative instrument used to hedge has the same underlying security as the exist ing position being hedged. d) The quantity of underlying associated with the derivative position taken for hedging purposes does not exceed the quantity of the existing position against which hedge has been taken. 6.",

The value of the notional principal in such cases must not exceed the value of respective existing assets being hedged by the scheme. (b) In case of participation in IRS is through over the counter transactions, the counter party has to be an entity recognized as a market maker by RBI and exposure to a single counterparty in such transactions should not exceed 10% of the net assets of the scheme. However, if mutual funds are transacting in IRS through an electronic trading platform offered by the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL) and CCIL is the central counterparty for such transactions guaranteeing settlement, the single counterparty limit of 10% shall not be applicable. 7. Exposure due to derivative positions taken for hedging purposes in excess of the underlying position against which the hedging position has been taken, shall be treated under the limits mentioned in point 1. 8. Definition of Exposure in case of Derivative Positions Each position taken in derivatives shall have an associated exposure as defined under. Exposure is the maximum possible loss that may occur on a position. However, certain derivative positions may theoretically have unlimited possible loss. Exposure in derivative positi ons shall be computed as follows: Position Exposure Long Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts Short Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts Option Bought Option Premium Paid * Lot Size * Number of Contracts Exposure limits on Credit Default Swaps (CDS) 47 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID Exposure through CDS (Notional amount of both CDS bought and sold) shall not exceed 10% of AUM of scheme and shall be within the overall limit of derivatives.

    "(IRF) The exposure limits for trading in Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) by Mutual Funds specified by clause 12.25.9 of Master Circular are as follows: i. To reduce interest rate risk in a debt portfolio, mutual funds may hedge the portfolio or part of the portfolio (including one or more securities) on weighted average modified duration basis by using Interest Rate Futures (IRFs). The maximum extent of short position that may be taken in IRFs to hedge interest rate risk of the portfolio or part of the portfolio, is as per the formula given below: (Portfolio Modified Duration* Market Value of the Portfolio) (Futures Modified Duration *Futures Price/PAR) ii. In case the IRF used for hedging the interest rate risk has different underlying security(s) than the existing position being hedged, it would result in imperfect hedging. iii. Imperfect hedging using IRFs may be considered to be exempted from the gross exposure, upto maximum of 20% of the net assets of the scheme, subject to the following: a) Exposure to IRFs is created only for hedging the interest rate risk based on the weighted average modified duration of the bond portfolio or part of the portfolio. b) Mutual Funds are permitted to resort to imperfect hedging, without it being considered under the gross exposure limits, if and only if, the correlation between the portfolio or part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged portions, if any) and the IRF is atleast 0.9 at the time of initiation of hedge. In case of any subsequent deviation from the correla tion criteria, the same may be rebalanced within 5 working days and if not rebalanced within the timeline, the derivative positions created for hedging shall be considered under the gross exposure computed in terms of clause 12.24.1 of Master Circular. The correlation should be calculated for a period of last 90 days. Explanation: If the fund manager intends to do imperfect hedging upto 15% of the portfolio using IRFs on weighted average modified duration basis, either of the following conditions need to b e complied with: i. The correlation for past 90 days between the portfolio and the IRF is at least 0.9 or ii.

Investment in international debt greatly expands the universe of top quality debt, which is no longer restricted to the limited papers available in the domestic debt market. The higher rated overseas sovereign, quasi - government and corporate debt offer lower default risk in addition to offering a high degree of liquidity since these are traded across major international markets. Investments in rated international debt offer multiple benefits of risk reduction, a much wider universe of top quality debt and also potential gains from currency movements. Investments in international markets are most often in U.S. dollars, though the Euro, Pound Sterling and the Yen are also major currencies. Though this market is geographi cally well spread across global financial 50 HDFC Mid Cap Fund-SID centres, the markets in the U.S., European Union and London offer the most liquidity and depth of instruments. Besides factors specific to the country / issuer, international bond prices are influenced to a large e xtent by a number of other factors; chief among these are the international economic outlook, changes in interest rates in major economies, trading volumes in overseas markets, cross currency movements among major currencies, rating changes of countries / corporations and major political changes globally.

    "the Scheme before the cut- off time - the closing NAV of the day shall be applicable. \u25cf In respect of valid applications received after 3.00 p.m. and where the funds for the entire amount are credited to the bank account of the Scheme either at any time on the same day or before the cut-off time of the next Business Day i.e. available for utilization before the cut-off time of the next Business Day - the closing NAV of the next Business Day shall be applicable. \u25cf Irrespective of the time of receipt of application, where the funds for the entire amount are credited to the b ank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time on any subsequent Business Day i.e. available for utilization before the cut-off time on any subsequent Business Day - the closing NAV of such subsequent Business Day shall be applicable. B] For Switch-ins of any amount: For determining the applicable NAV, the following shall be ensured: \u25cf Application for switch-in is received before the applicable cut-off time. \u25cf Funds for the entire amount of subscription/purchase as per the switch-in request are credited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time. \u25cf The funds are available for utilization before the cut-off time. \u25cf In case of \u2018switch\u2019 transactions from one scheme to another, the allocation shall be in line with redemption payouts. In case of switches, the request should be received on a day which is a Business Day for the Switch-out scheme. Redemption for switch-out shall be processed at the applicable NAV as per cut-off timing.

    "the funds are available for utilization by the Target Scheme irrespective of the installment date of the SIP, STP or record date of IDCW etc. While the AMC will endeavour to deposit the payment instruments accompanying investment application submitted to it with its bank expeditiously, it shall not be liable for delay in realization of funds on account of factors beyond its control such as clearing / settlement cycles of the banks. Since different payment modes have different settlement cycles including electronic transactions (as per arrangements with Payment Aggregators / Banks / Exchanges etc), it may happen that the investor's account is debited, but the money is not credited within cut -off time on the same date to the Scheme's bank account, leading to a gap / delay in Unit allotment. Investors are therefore urged to use the most efficient elec tronic payment modes to avoid delays in realization of funds and consequently in Unit allotment.

Investment Strategy The investment objective of the Scheme is to generate long term capital appreciation by investing in equity and equity related securities of large cap, mid cap and small cap companies. The Scheme will maintain a minimum exposure of 25% of its total assets in each market cap category viz. Large cap, Mid cap & Small cap. The Scheme may also invest upto 25% of its total assets in debt and money market securities. The Scheme will remain diversified across key sectors and economic variables. The Scheme may also invest in the hybrid secu rities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for diversification and subject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time. Subject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may engage in Stock Lending activities. Investment in debt sec urities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their outlook. The Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF) Regulations. As part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as futures and options, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible in future under applicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for restricted purposes as permitted by the regulations. For detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI.

No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme. 6 HDFC Multi Cap Fund - KIM 8. Risk Profile of the Scheme Mutual Fund Units involve investment risks including the possible loss of principal. Please read the details on risk factors carefully before investment. Scheme specific Risk Factors are summarized below: Scheme Specific Risk Factors: The Scheme will maintain a minimum exposure of 25% of its total assets in each market cap category viz. Large cap, Mid cap & Small cap. While Small & Mid -cap stocks gives one an opportunity to go beyond the usual large blue chip stocks and present possible higher capital appreciation, it is important to note that Small & Mid-cap stocks can be riskier and more volatile on a relative basis. Therefore, the risk levels of investing in Small & Midcap stocks are generally more than investing in stocks of large w ell- established companies. It should be noted that over a period of time, Small, Mid and Large cap stocks have demonstrated different levels of volatility and investment returns. And it is important to note that generally, no one class consistently outperforms the others. (i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments \u25cf Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks. \u25cf Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk. \u25cf While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability",
    "illiquid in nature and carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk. \u25cf While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u25cf Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances. (ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities \u2022 The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates. \u2022 Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u2022 Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of the issuers. \u2022 Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgr aded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes 7 HDFC Multi Cap Fund - KIM in economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's c redit quality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis. \u2022 Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields, resulting in",
    "\u2022 Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme. \u2022 Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed. \u2022 Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unfo reseen circumstances. Delays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in the Scheme's portfolio. \u2022 Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price -risk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price -risk is not unique to Government S ecurities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the sense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by movement in interest rates in the financial system. \u2022 Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in",
    "all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the sense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by movement in interest rates in the financial system. \u2022 Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e. g. corporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated bonds. \u2022 The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest i n lower rated / unrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio. \u2022 As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securiti es that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securiti es begin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It 8 HDFC Multi Cap Fund - KIM also varies dependin g on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically. (iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: \u2022 Except for any security of an associate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a stock exchange (\u201cunlisted Securities\u201d) which in general are subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary",
    "or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a stock exchange (\u201cunlisted Securities\u201d) which in general are subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value. \u2022 Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer -specific developments. Such investments display increased price sensitivity t o changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities. (iv) Risks associated with Investing in Struc tured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated securities The risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to the risk factors associated with debt instruments. \u2022 Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and could include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter of comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity could be either related or non -related to the issuer like a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of the credit e nhancement provider, as well as the issuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan pools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer. \u2022 Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit enhancements. Debt securities lack a well -developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the mar ket for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead",
    "well -developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the mar ket for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold. \u2022 Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could have an a dverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case o f SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, apart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit risk. 9 HDFC Multi Cap Fund - KIM (v) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri -party Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments. The members are requi red to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL). As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's contribution if there is a residual lo ss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non -defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of",
    "to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's contribution if there is a residual lo ss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non -defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In additi on, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member). CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the defaul t fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund. (vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities \u25cf Currency Risk: Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currenc ies, the Indian Rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related, can differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to their interest rate cycles. \u25cf Credit Risk: Investment in Foreign Debt Securities are sub ject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in de bt instruments with rating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency. 10 HDFC Multi Cap Fund - KIM \u25cf Taxation Risk: In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI) under section \u201c Special Consideration\u201d, Investment in Foreign Securities",
    "only in de bt instruments with rating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency. 10 HDFC Multi Cap Fund - KIM \u25cf Taxation Risk: In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI) under section \u201c Special Consideration\u201d, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges based on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation. The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its investment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing / evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invest s. All these may entail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk: Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject could dif fer materially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively. \u25cf Country Risk: The Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi - lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of trades or otherwise. \u25cf To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time. \u2022 Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities: In case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by regulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any",
    "conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time. \u2022 Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities: In case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by regulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in permissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity. (vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives \u25cf The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative prod ucts, from time to time, in an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with stock s and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices. \u25cf Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the 11 HDFC Multi Cap Fund - KIM strategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies. \u25cf The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. \u25cf Credit Risk: The credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. \u25cf Market Risk: Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. \u25cf Illiquidity risk: This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of liquidity in the market. Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging u sing Interest Rate Futures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads",
    "at a fair price, due to lack of liquidity in the market. Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging u sing Interest Rate Futures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. (viii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares \u25cf Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non - cumulative preference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on pr eference shares in case of inadequate profits in any year. \u25cf Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity. \u25cf Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is significant risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation. (ix)Risk pertaining to covered call strategy Incorrectly pricing the option premium before writing the covered call by ignoring factors which determine pricing like number of days to expiry, adjustment with respect to announced corporate actions like dividend etc. (x) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending As with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to 12 HDFC Multi Cap Fund - KIM return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss of opportunity. (xi) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised",
    "lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss of opportunity. (xi) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt The Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive. \u25cf Limited Liquidity & Price Risk There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the ability of the investor to resell them. \u25cf Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk The Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in th e underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors' Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However, many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length o f time required to realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may be lower than the amount due from that Obligor. \u25cf Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs In the event of prepayments, investo rs may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs). \u25cf Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could experience losses or delays in the payments. \u25cf Risk of Co-mingling With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing the",
    "proceedings then an investor could experience losses or delays in the payments. \u25cf Risk of Co-mingling With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing the same into the Collection account especially considering that some of the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to a potential loss. (xii) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI) Perpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital Regulations are referred to as Addition al Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are 13 HDFC Multi Cap Fund - KIM no regulatory guidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds as per guidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below: Key Risk Factors: - Risk on coupon servicing Banks As per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow banks to make payment of coupons. NBFCs While NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, co upon can also be deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios. Corporates Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually cumulative and any deferre d coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI. - Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks As per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET-1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written down. Further, AT -1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity,",
    "or conversion into equity Banks As per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET-1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written down. Further, AT -1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non -viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT -1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior t o public sector injection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. - Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer Banks The issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period fr om the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not exercise the call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. NBFCs The NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. 14 HDFC Multi Cap Fund - KIM Corporates There is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call option, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date. (xiii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling Short-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short",
    "loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio. (xiv) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs: \u25cf Price Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. \u25cf Credit Risk: Credit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled. \u25cf Liquidity Risk: This refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for which a liquid m arket exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk. \u25cf Reinvestment Risk: Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be repatriation of funds by th e Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay -outs, etc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk 15 HDFC Multi Cap Fund - KIM The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators",
    "Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk 15 HDFC Multi Cap Fund - KIM The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions. (xv) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities In repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with the seller agreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater than the original sale price, the difference effectively represent ing interest. A repo in corporate debt securities is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporate debt securities as collateral to protect against default. Some of the risks associated with repo in corporate debt are given below: Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy back securities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In case of over the counter (OTC) repo trades, the investment manager will endeavo ur to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with counterparties having strong credit profiles. Also, the counter -party risk is to an extent mitigated by taking collateral equivalent in value to the transaction after knocking off a minimum haircut on the intrinsic value of the collateral. In the event of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate debt securities. In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may also provide settlement guarantee. Collateral Risk : Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to meet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held",
    "of the securities is inadequate to meet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for replacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by considering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The fund manager or the exchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a prespecified period. If the counterparty is not able to top -up either in form of cash / collateral, it would tantamount to early termination of the repo agreement, and the outstanding amount can be recovered by sale of collateral. (xvi) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes 16 HDFC Multi Cap Fund - KIM 1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes. 2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads. (xvii) General Risk factors \u2022 Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down bec ause of various factors that affect the capital markets in general. \u2022 As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be",
    "up or down bec ause of various factors that affect the capital markets in general. \u2022 As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under cer tain circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend Redemption of the units. \u2022 At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest in securities falling within it s investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day -to-day liquidity requirements. \u2022 Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark part icularly over a short to medium term period. \u2022 Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies. \u2022 The Scheme at times m ay receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset - liability mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments. For details on risk mitigation measures, please refer SID. 9. Plans/ Options Plans: Regular & Direct Regular and Direct Plans offer the following options: (a) Growth Option (b) Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) Option Under this Option, it is proposed to declare income / capital Distribution (IDCW) subject to availability of distributable surplus, as computed in accordance with SEBI (MF) Regulations.

Applicable NAV (after the scheme opens for subscriptions and redemptions) The below cut -off timings and applicability of NAV shall be applicable in respect of valid applications received at the Official Point(s) of Acceptance on a Business Day (During Continuous Offer Period): A] For Purchase (including switch-in) of any amount: \u25cf In respect of valid applications received upto 3.00 p.m. and where the funds for the entire amount are available for utilization before the cut -off time i.e. credited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time - the closing NAV of the day shall be applicable. \u25cf In respect of valid appli cations received after 3.00 p.m. and where the funds for the entire amount are credited to the bank account of the Scheme either at any time on the same day or before the cut -off time of the next Business Day i.e. available for utilization before the cut-off time of the next Business Day - the closing NAV of the next Business Day shall be applicable. \u25cf Irrespective of the time of receipt of application, where the funds for the entire amount are credited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut -off t ime on any subsequent Business Day i.e. available for utilization before the cut -off time on any subsequent Business Day - the closing NAV of such subsequent Business Day shall be applicable. B] For Switch-ins of any amount: For determining the applicable NAV, the following shall be ensured: \u25cf Application for switch-in is received before the applicable cut-off time. \u25cf Funds for the entire amount of subscription/purchase as per the switch -in request are credited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time. \u25cf The funds are available for utilization before the cut-off time. \u25cf In case of \u2018switch\u2019 transactions from one scheme to another, the allocation shall be in line with redemption payouts. In case of switches,",

In case of switches, the request should be received on a day which is a Business Day for the Switch -out scheme. Redemption for switch -out shall be processed at the applicable NAV as per cut-off timing. Switch-in will be processed at the Applicable NAV (on a Business Day) based on realization of funds as per t he redemption pay -out cycle for the switch -out scheme. For investments through systematic investment routes such as Systematic Investment Plans (SIP), Flex SIP, Systematic Transfer Plans (STP), Flex -STP, Swing STP, Transfer of Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) Plan facility (TIP), etc. the unit s will be allotted as per the closing NAV of the day on which the funds are available for utilization by the Target Scheme irrespective of the installment date of the SIP, STP or record date of IDCW etc. While the AMC will endeavour to deposit the paymen t instruments accompanying investment application submitted to it with its bank expeditiously, it shall not be liable for delay in realization 18 HDFC Multi Cap Fund - KIM of funds on account of factors beyond its control such as clearing / settlement cycles of the banks. Since diffe rent payment modes have different settlement cycles including electronic transactions (as per arrangements with Payment Aggregators / Banks / Exchanges etc), it may happen that the investor's account is debited, but the money is not credited within cut -off time on the same date to the Scheme's bank account, leading to a gap / delay in Unit allotment. Investors are therefore urged to use the most efficient electronic payment modes to avoid delays in realization of funds and consequently in Unit allotment.

    "Fund-SID For detailed disclosures, kindly refer Section II. C. WHAT ARE THE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES? The investment objective of the Scheme is to generate long term capital appreciation by investing in equity and equity related securities of large cap, mid cap and small cap companies. The Scheme will maintain a minimum exposure of 25% of its total assets in each market cap category viz. Large cap, Mid cap & Small cap. The Scheme may also invest upto 25% of its total assets in debt and money market securities. The Scheme will remain diversified across key sectors and economic variables. The Scheme may also invest in the hybrid secu rities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for diversification and subject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time. Subject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may engage in Stock Lending activities. Investment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their outlook. The Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF) Regulations. As part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as futures and options, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible in future under applicable regulations. However, trading in deriva tives by the Scheme shall be for restricted purposes as permitted by the regulations. For detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI. For exposure limits to derivatives, refer section \u2018Where will the scheme invest\u2019 under Section II, Part II, Clause A Though every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the AMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved. No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme. Risk Control Investments made by the Scheme would be in accordance with the investment objectives of the scheme and provisions of SEBI (MF) Regulations. Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would incorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio construction process. The risk control process involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this diversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use various derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time, with an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio",
    "for the same. The AMC believes that this diversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use various derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time, with an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest. While these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would be completely eliminated. PORTFOLIO TURNOVER The Scheme is an open -ended Scheme. The portfolio is managed from a long term perspective with an endeavour to keep portfolio turnover ratio low. However, it is expected that there would be a number of subscriptions and redemptions on a daily basis. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable 15 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID measure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage and transaction cost. D. HOW WILL THE SCHEME BENCHMARK ITS PERFORMANCE? Nifty 500 MULTICAP 50:25:25 (TRI) As required under clause 1.9 of Master Circular, the benchmark has been selected from amongst those notified by AMFI as the first tier benchmark to be adopted by mutual funds and which are reflective of the category of the scheme.

The AMC will value its investments according to the valuation norms, as specified in Schedule VIII of the SEBI (MF) Regulations, or such norms as may be specified by SEBI from time to time and as stipulated in the Valuation Policy and Procedures of the Fund, provided in SAI available on website. In case of any conflict between the Principles of Fair Valuation and valuation guidelines specified by SEBI, the Principles of Fair Valuation shall prevail. NAV of Units under each Scheme/ Plan shall be calculated as shown below: NAV (Rs.) = per Unit Market or Fair Value of the Scheme\u2019s Investments + Current Assets - Current Liabilities and Provisions _____________________________________________ 21 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID No. of Units outstanding under the Scheme/Plan The NAV of the Scheme will be calculated and disclosed at the close of every Business Day. Separate NAV will be calculated and announced for each of Plans/Options. The NAVs will be calculated upto 3 decimals. Units will be allotted upto 3 decimals.

Load amounts are variable and are subject to change from time to time. For the current applicable structure, please refer to the website of the AMC (www.hdfcfund.com) or you may call at 1800 3010 6767/1800 419 7676 or your distributor. Type of Load Load chargeable (as %age of NAV) Exit Load - In respect of each purchase / switch-in of Units, an Exit Load of 1.00% is payable if Units are redeemed/ switched -out within 1 year from the date of allotment. - No Exit Load is payable if Units are redeemed / switched -out after 1 year from the date of allotment. No Entry Load will be charged. (i) No Exit Load shall be levied for switching between Plans / Options within the Scheme. However, exit load will be applicable if the units are switched-out / redeemed from the Scheme within the exit load period",
    "1 year from the date of allotment. No Entry Load will be charged. (i) No Exit Load shall be levied for switching between Plans / Options within the Scheme. However, exit load will be applicable if the units are switched-out / redeemed from the Scheme within the exit load period from the initial date of purchase. (ii) No Exit load will be levied on bonus Units and on units allotted on Re-investment of Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal. (iii) No Exit load will be levied on Units allotted in the Target Scheme under the Transfer of Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) Plan Facility (TIP Facility).

Exit load (net of GST) charged, if any, shall be credited to the Scheme. The investor is requested to check the prevailing load structure of the Scheme before investing. 27 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID SECTION II I. INTRODUCTION A. DEFINITIONS / INTERPRETATION Visit: https://www.hdfcfund.com/statutory-disclosure/offer-document-disclosures B. RISK FACTORS \u25a0 Scheme Specific Risk Factors: Some of the specific risk factors related to the Scheme include, but are not limited to the following: Scheme Specific Risk Factors: The Scheme will maintain a minimum exposure of 25% of its total assets in each market cap category viz. Large cap, Mid cap & Small cap. While Small & Mid-cap stocks gives one an opportunity to go beyond the usual large blue chip stocks and present possible higher capital appreciation, it is important to note that Small & Mid-cap stocks can be riskier and more volatile on a relative basis. Therefore, the risk levels of investing in",
    "Small & Mid-cap stocks gives one an opportunity to go beyond the usual large blue chip stocks and present possible higher capital appreciation, it is important to note that Small & Mid-cap stocks can be riskier and more volatile on a relative basis. Therefore, the risk levels of investing in Small & Midcap stocks are generally more than investing in stocks of large well- established companies. It should be noted that over a period of time, Small, Mid and Large cap stocks have demonstrated different levels of volatility and investment returns. And it is important to note that generally, no one class consistently outperforms the others. (i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments \u25cf Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks. \u25cf Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk. \u25cf While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u25cf Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances. (ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities \u2022 The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates. \u2022 Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u2022 Investments in money market instruments involve credit",
    "in the level of interest rates. \u2022 Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u2022 Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of the issuers. 28 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID \u2022 Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all o f which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis. \u2022 Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme. \u2022 Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed. \u2022 Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a",
    "could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in the Scheme's portfolio. \u2022 Government securities where a fixed r eturn is offered run price -risk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of t he existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government Securities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the sense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are infl uenced only by movement in interest rates in the financial system. \u2022 Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme ris k may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated bonds. \u2022 The AMC m ay, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio. \u2022 As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do",
    "are subject to issuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically. 29 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID (iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: Except for any security of an associate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a stock exchange (\u201cunlisted Securities\u201d) which in general are subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value. \u2022 Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer-specific developments. Such investments display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities. (iv) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated securities The risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to the risk factors associated with debt instruments. \u2022 Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and could include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter o f comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity could be either related or non -related to the",
    "to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and could include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter o f comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity could be either related or non -related to the issuer like a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of the credit e nhancement provider, as well as the issuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan pools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer. \u2022 Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit enhancements. Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold. \u2022 Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case o f SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, apart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit risk. (v) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities",
    "such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit risk. (v) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri-party Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL). 30 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's contribution if there is a residual lo ss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non - defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In additi on, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member). CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the defaul t fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund. (vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities \u25cf Currency Risk: Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies , the Indian Rupee equivalent of the",
    "fund. (vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities \u25cf Currency Risk: Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies , the Indian Rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related, can differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to their interest rate cycles. \u25cf Credit Risk: Investment in Foreign Debt Securities are subjec t to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with rating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency. \u25cf Taxation Risk: In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI) under section \u201c Special Consideration\u201d, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges based on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation. The Scheme may be sub ject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its investment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing / evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All these may entail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk: Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject could differ materially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively. 31 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID \u25cf Country Risk: The Country",
    "be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject could differ materially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively. 31 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID \u25cf Country Risk: The Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as intr oduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of trades or otherwise. \u25cf To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time. \u2022 Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities: In case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by regulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in permissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity. (vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives \u25cf The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices. \u25cf Derivative p roducts are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such",
    "of the fund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies. \u25cf The risks associat ed with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. \u25cf Credit Risk: The credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. \u25cf Market Risk: Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. \u25cf Illiquidity risk: This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of liquidity in the market. Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate Futures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. (viii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares \u25cf Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non-cumulative preference 32 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on preference shares in case of inadequate profits in any year. \u25cf Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity. \u25cf Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is significant risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation. (ix)Risk pertaining to covered call strategy Incorrectly pricing the option premium before writing the covered call by ignoring factors which determine pricing like number of days to expiry, adjustment with respect to announced corporate actions like dividend etc. (x)",
    "risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation. (ix)Risk pertaining to covered call strategy Incorrectly pricing the option premium before writing the covered call by ignoring factors which determine pricing like number of days to expiry, adjustment with respect to announced corporate actions like dividend etc. (x) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending As with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the term s of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss of opportunity. (xi) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt The Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive. \u25cf Limited Liquidity & Price Risk There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the ability of the investor to resell them. \u25cf Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk The Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors' Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancem ent facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However, many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length",
    "the amount available in the Credit Enhancem ent facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However, many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length o f time required to realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may be lower than the amount due from that Obligor. \u25cf Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs). \u25cf Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility 33 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could experience losses or delays in the payments. \u25cf Risk of Co-mingling With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing the same into the Collection account especially considering that some of the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to a potential loss. (xii) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI) Perpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital Regulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory guidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds as per guidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below: Key Risk Factors: - Risk on coupon servicing Banks As per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses",
    "The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below: Key Risk Factors: - Risk on coupon servicing Banks As per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow banks to make payment of coupons. NBFCs While NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, co upon can also be deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios. Corporates Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI. - Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks As per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET- 1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written down. Further, AT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. - Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer Banks The issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period from the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not exercise the 34 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. NBFCs The NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. Corporates There is no minimum period",
    "as per the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. Corporates There is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call option, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date. (xiii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling Short-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and returns the stock to clos e out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates , short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio. (xiv) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs: \u25cf Price Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. \u25cf Credit Risk: Credit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled. \u25cf Liquidity Risk: This refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time when",
    "have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled. \u25cf Liquidity Risk: This refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The s ubsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for which a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk. \u25cf Reinvestment Risk: 35 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay -outs, etc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amen dments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions. (xv) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities In repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with the seller agreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater than the original sale price, the difference effectively representing interest. A repo in corporate debt securities is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporate debt securities as collateral to protect against default. Some of the risks associated with repo in corporate debt are given below: Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy back securities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In case of over the counter (OTC) repo trades, the investment manager will endeavour to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with counterparties having strong credit profiles. Also,",
    "to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy back securities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In case of over the counter (OTC) repo trades, the investment manager will endeavour to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with counterparties having strong credit profiles. Also, the counter-party risk is to an extent mitigated by taking collateral equivalent in value to the transaction after knocking off a minimum haircut on the intrinsic value of the collateral. In the event of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate debt securities. In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may also provide settlement guarantee. Collateral Risk: Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to meet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for replacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security t han required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by considering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The fund manager or the exchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a prespecified period. If the counterparty is not able to top-up either in form of cash / collateral, it would tantamount to early termination of the repo agreement, and the outstanding amount can be recovered by sale of collateral. (xvi) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes 1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes. 2.

    "Schemes 1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes. 2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads. 36 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID (xvii) General Risk factors \u2022 Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down because of various factors that affect the capital markets in general. \u2022 As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under certain circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend Redemption of the units. \u2022 At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest in securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity requirements. \u2022 Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to medium term period. \u2022 Performance of the Sche me may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies. \u2022 The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset - liability mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale",
    "be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies. \u2022 The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset - liability mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments. C. RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES Risk Mitigation measures for investments in equity / equity related and debt instruments The Scheme\u2019s portfolio shall comprise allocation to large cap stocks between 25% and 50% of total assets. This flexibility of investing in large-cap stocks shall aid in managing volatility and also aid reasonable liquidity. Within its investment universe, the Scheme aims to maintain a well -diversified equity portfolio comprising stocks across various sectors of the economy. This shall aid in managing concentration risk and sector specific risks. Credit Evaluation Policy The credit evaluation policy of the AMC entails evaluation of credit fundamentals of each investment opportunity. Some of the factors that are evaluated inter -alia may include outlook on the sector, parentage, quality of management, and overall financial s trength of the credit. The AMC utilises ratings of recognized rating agencies as an input in the credit evaluation process. Investments in bonds and debenture are usually in instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by a recognized rating agency. In line with clause 12.12 of Master Circular, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals for investments in unrated instruments. The AMC Board and the Trustee shall approve the detailed parameters for such investments. The details of such investments would be communicated by the AMC to the Trustee in their periodical reports. It would also be clearly mentioned in the reports, how the parameters have been 37 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID complied with. However, in case any security does not fall under the parameters, the prior approval of Board of AMC and Trustee shall be sought. Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to sell / liquidate a security at short notice at prevailing market prices or without incurring impact cost. While governme nt bonds, money market instruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easier to sell, corporate bonds and other instruments typically face higher liquidity risk.

    "at short notice at prevailing market prices or without incurring impact cost. While governme nt bonds, money market instruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easier to sell, corporate bonds and other instruments typically face higher liquidity risk. Further, higher rated securities normally are more liquid compared to lower rated securities. As a result, different portfolios will face different levels of liquidity risk based on the underlying portfolio composition. Some of the strategies to reduce liquidity risk are creating portfolios that are diversified across maturities, rating s, types of securities, etc. in line with the fund objectives, regulations and investment strategy. Credit Risk: Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence, credit risk faced by different schemes will be d ifferent based on the underlying portfolio / investment strategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and quali tative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Each of the scheme/portfolio will endeavour to maintain adequate diversification across issuers / sectors in line with scheme objectives, regulations and investment strategy. Unrated investments, if any, woul d require specific approval from a committee constituted for the purpose. Debt Derivatives Risk: The AMC has provision for using derivative instruments for portfolio balancing and hedging purposes. Interest Rate Swaps will be done with approved counter p arties under pre approved ISDA agreements. Mark to Market of swaps, netting off of cash flow and default provision clauses will be provided as per standard practice on a reciprocal basis. Interest Rate Swaps and other derivative instruments will be used as per local (RBI and SEBI) regulatory guidelines. Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk of change in the NAVs due to change in overall market yields. The change in value of a security, for a given change in yield, is higher for a security wit h higher duration and vice versa. Hence portfolios with higher duration will have higher volatility. The AMC shall strive to actively manage the duration of the respective funds based on the prevailing market conditions / outlook of interest rates, keeping in mind the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable regulations. Concentration Risk: The AMC will attempt to mitigate this risk by maintaining adequate diversification across issuers/ sectors / instrument type in line with the scheme objectives, investment",
    "funds based on the prevailing market conditions / outlook of interest rates, keeping in mind the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable regulations. Concentration Risk: The AMC will attempt to mitigate this risk by maintaining adequate diversification across issuers/ sectors / instrument type in line with the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable regulations. This will also be managed by keeping prudent investment limits on any particular industry or issuer or issuer group based on the size, credit profile, etc. to reduce issuer or industry specific risk. Risk Mitigation factors relating to investment in Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI): \u2022 Risk on coupon servicing and Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks: The risks on coupon servicing or principal write down/ conversion to equity are mitigated, to a certain extent, if the investee bank has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory guidelines. Hence, an in -depth credit evaluation of each ba nk is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed. Investment is done only in the AT -1 bonds of banks with strong credit worthiness, in our assessment. This, in turn, reduces the risk of its capital position falling below regulatory requirements and / or reaching PONV. Risk of write-down or conversion into equity is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. 38 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID \u2022 Risk on coupon servicing NBFCs These risks are mitigated, to certain extent, if the investee NBFC has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory guidelines. Hence, an in-depth credit evaluation of each NBFC is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed. Corporates To mitigate this risk, an in -depth credit evaluation of each corporate is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, industry position, market share e tc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Additionally, given that the coupon is usually cumulative in nature",
    "in case it is needed. Corporates To mitigate this risk, an in -depth credit evaluation of each corporate is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, industry position, market share e tc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Additionally, given that the coupon is usually cumulative in nature and the corporate is restricted from paying any dividends till all previous dues are paid to the perpetual bond investor, the company has adequate incentive to not defer coupon on PDIs. \u2022 Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer Banks While the issuer bank does have an option to not exercise the first call, experience suggests that all Indian banks till now have exercised the call option during the call period. We believe that banks are cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to risk of not exercising the call option at the first call date. Further, as we invest in issuers with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to understand the importance of exercising the call as the part of their long term capital raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of call option exercise can lead to increase in cost of AT1 bonds for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond tenors) and impact the bank's profitability adversely. Given the importance of AT1 instruments for prudently managing the capital levels and improving the returns for the equity holders, we are of the opinion that banks would choose to service the interest on AT1 bonds and exercise the first call option on AT1 bonds, as they have done in the past. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual instrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the annual call on these instruments would enable the bank to call the bond on any of the subsequent annual call options dates. NBFCs and Corporates While the issuer is not obligated to exercise the call option on first call date, the coupon step -up usually provides financial incentive to the Issuer to exercise the call option. Further, as we invest in issuer with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to be cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to exercising the call as the part of their long term resource raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of first call option exercise can lead to increase in cost of PDI for future issuance",

Finally, in case th e issuer is unable to call the perpetual instrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the coupon step up also compensates the investor for extended holding period. While these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would be completely eliminated. II. INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCHEME: A.

Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs), the proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling his loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much before the mat urity of the underlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from borrowers. Typically, the transaction is provided with a limited amount of credit enhancement (as stipulated by the rating agency for a target rating), which provides protection to investors against defaults by the underlying borrowers. Generally available asset classes for securitisation in India are: \u25cf Commercial vehicles \u25cf Auto and two wheeler pools \u25cf Mortgage pools (residential housing loans) \u25cf Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans \u25cf Corporate loans/receivables 42 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID Investment / Risk Mitigation Strategy 1. Risk profile of securitised debt vis-\u00e0-vis risk appetite of the Scheme The risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities at the same level of credit rating.

    "appetite of the Scheme The risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities at the same level of credit rating. Securitised debt offers additional income (spread) over a debt security of similar rating and maturity, which enables the scheme to optimize its income without taking any additional credit risk. Securitised debt is generally less liquid, however, investment in securitised debt is made to maintain a diversified portfolio of debt securities that optimizes return without increasing the overall risk profile of the Scheme. 2. Policy relating to originators based on nature of originator, track record, NPAs, losses in earlier securitised debt, etc The originator is an entity (like banks, non-banking finance companies, corporates etc), which has initially provided the loan & is also generally responsible for servicing the loans. The schemes will invest in securitised debt of originators with at least investment grade credit rating and established track record. A detailed evaluation of originator is done before the investment is made in securitised debt of any originator on various parameters given below: \u25cf Track record The investment in securitised debt is done based on origination and underwriting process and capabilities of the originator, overview of corporate structure, group to which they belong, experience of the company in the business & how long they have been in the business, financial condition of the company, credit rating, past performance of similar pools by the originator, etc. \u25cf Willingness to pay through credit enhancement facilities etc. Credit enhancement is provided by the originator, as indicated by rating agencies, so as to adequately cover the defaults and acts as a risk mitigation measure. The size of the credit enhancement as indicated by rating agency depends on the originator's track record, past delinquencies, pattern of the portfolio & characteristics of the pool vis-a-vis of the portfolio, nature of the asset class. \u25cf Ability to pay The quality of the origination impacts the performance of the underlying asset & thus originators with strong systems and processes in place can eliminate poor quality assets. A robust risk management system of the originator and availability of MIS reports on timely basis, results in creation of strong asset portfolio. \u25cf Business Risk Assessment The business risk assessment of originator / underlying borrower also includes detailed credit assessment wherein following factors are also considered: - Outlook for the economy (domestic and global)",
    "of the originator and availability of MIS reports on timely basis, results in creation of strong asset portfolio. \u25cf Business Risk Assessment The business risk assessment of originator / underlying borrower also includes detailed credit assessment wherein following factors are also considered: - Outlook for the economy (domestic and global) - Outlook for the industry - Company specific factors In addition, a detailed review and assessment of rating rationale is done along with interactions with the company as well as the rating agency. All investment in securitised debt is done after taking into account, the Critical Evaluation Parameters (for pool loan and single loan securitisation transactions) regarding the originator / underlying issuer as mentioned below: \u25cf Default track record/ frequent alteration of redemption conditions / covenants \u25cf High leverage ratios of the ultimate borrower (for single -sell downs) - both on a standalone basis as well on a consolidated level/ group level \u25cf Higher proportion of reschedulement of underlying assets of the pool or loan, as the case may be \u25cf Higher proportion of overdue assets of the pool or the underlying loan, as the case may be \u25cf Poor reputation in market \u25cf Insufficient track record of servicing of the pool or the loan, as the case may be. 43 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID 3. Risk mitigation strategies for investments with each kind of originator Investments are based on assessment of following parameters, so as to mitigate risk associated with such investment: a. Credit quality, size and reach of the originator b. Nature of receivables/asset category i.e. cars, construction equipment, commercial vehicles, personal loans etc. c. Collection process, infrastructure and follow-up mechanism d. Quality of MIS e. Credit cum liquidity enhancement f. Credit appraisal norms of originator g. Asset Quality - portfolio delinquency levels h. Past performance of rated pools i. Pool Characteristics - seasoning, Loan-to-value ratios, geographic diversity etc. 4. The level of diversification with respect to the underlying assets, and risk mitigation measures for less diversified investments Diversification of underlying assets is achieved through a) prudent mix of asset categories - i.e. cars (new, used), commercial vehicles, construction equipment, unsecured loans to individuals or small & medium enterprises b) total nu mber of contracts in a pool c) average ticket size of loans and d) geographical distribution. Risk mitigation measures for less diversified investments in pools is accomplished through the size of credit enhancement, seasoning or loan",

Notes: A. In case of securitised debt with underlying being single loan, the investment limit applicable to the underlying borrower is considered. B. Other investment will be decided on a case to case basis. In case of asset backed pools (ABS), evaluation of the pool assets is done considering the following factors: (Refer the table above which illustrates the averages of parameters considered while selecting the pool) \u2022 Size of the loan \u2022 Average original maturity of the pool \u2022 Loan to Value Ratio \u2022 Average seasoning of the pool \u2022 Default rate distribution \u2022 Geographical Distribution \u2022 Credit enhancement facility \u2022 Liquid facility \u2022 Structure of the pool 5. Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation The illustrative average seasoning of the debt by originator prior to securitisation is given above in table (Refer Point 4). Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation in the case of asset pools is in the form of seasoning of loans to various asset classes (cars, commer cial vehicles, etc.) and generally varies from one month to six months depending on the nature of asset. 6.",
    "Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation in the case of asset pools is in the form of seasoning of loans to various asset classes (cars, commer cial vehicles, etc.) and generally varies from one month to six months depending on the nature of asset. 6. Minimum retention percentage by originator of debts to be securitised While minimum retention percentage by originator is not prescribed, any amount retained by the originator through subordination is viewed positively at the time of making investment and generally varies from 5% to 10%. 7. The mechanism to tackle conflict of interest when the mutual fund invests in securitised debt of an originator and the originator in turn makes investments in that particular scheme of the fund All proposals for investment in securitised debt are evaluated by the credit analyst based on several parameters such as nature of underlying asset category, pool char acteristics, asset quality, credit rating of the securitisation transaction, and credit cum liquidity enhancement available. Investment in securitised debt in any scheme is made by the respective fund manager in line with the investment objective of that scheme. 8. The resources and mechanism of individual risk assessment with the AMC for monitoring investment in securitised debt (in general) Investment in securitised debt is monitored regularly with regards to its performance on various parameters suc h as collection efficiency, delinquencies, prepayments and utilization of credit enhancement.

Trading in Derivatives \u2022 The Scheme may take derivatives position based on the opportunities available subject to the guidelines provided by SEBI from time to time and in line with the overall investment objective of the Scheme. \u2022 The Scheme intends to use derivatives mainly for the purpose of hedging and portfolio balancing. Losses may arise as a result of using derivatives, but these are likely to be compensated by the gains on the underlying cash instruments held by the Scheme. \u2022 The Scheme may take position in derivative instruments like Futures, Options, and such other derivative instruments as may be permitted by SEBI from time to time.

Position limit for Mutual Funds in index options contracts a) The Mutual Fund position limit in all index options contracts at PAN level shall be as follows: i. Net end of day FutEq OI limit for options to be \u20b91,500 cr. and ii. Gross end of day FutEq OI to be \u20b910,000 cr. (i.e. neither gross long FutEq OI nor gross short FutEq OI shall exceed \u20b910,000 cr.) This limit would be applicable on open positions in all options contracts on a particular Underlying Index. ii. Position limit for Mutual Funds in index futures contracts a) The Mutual Fund position limit in all index futures contracts on a particular Underlying Index shall be higher of 15% of futures OI for that index or \u20b9500 cr. b) This limit would be applicable on open positions in all futures contracts on a particular Underlying Index. c) The above stated position limits for index futures would be measured on gross notional basis. The position limits shall be computed on a gross basis at the level of MF and on a net basis at the level of schemes of MF. Formulation of Open Interest (OI) i. OI in derivatives shall be measured at portfolio level by computing the net Delta adjusted open positions across futu res and options for an underlying at a given point in time. Delta denotes sensitivity of price movement of derivative position with respect to that of the underlying. Accordingly, long futures have a delta of +1 times notional. For options, delta will range between 0 and +1 times notional for long calls and between 0 and \u20131 times notional for long puts. In case of short options position, effective delta",

Definition of Exposure in case of Derivative Positions Each position taken in derivatives shall have an associated exposure as defined under. Exposure is the maximum possible loss that may occur on a position. However, certain derivative positions may theoretically have unlimited possible loss. Exposure in derivative positions shall be computed as follows: Position Exposure Long Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts Short Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts Option Bought Option Premium Paid * Lot Size * Number of Contracts Exposure on account of call option written under the covered call strategy: The Scheme will write call options only under a covered call strategy for constituent stocks of NIFTY 50 and BSE SENSEX subject to the following: 48 HDFC Multi Cap Fund-SID a) The total notional value (taking into account strike price as well as premium value) of call options written shall not exceed 15% of the total market value of the underlying equity shares held at all points in time.

    "aims to maintain a reasonably diversified portfolio at all times. The Scheme may also invest a certain portion of its corpus in debt and money market securities. Investment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their outlook. The Scheme may also invest in the hybrid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for diversification and subject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time. Subject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may engage in Stoc k Lending activities. The Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF) Regulations. As part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as futures and options, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible in future under applicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for restricted purposes as permitted by the regulations. For detailed derivative strategies, p lease refer to SAI. For exposure limits to derivatives, refer section \u2018Where will the scheme invest\u2019 under Section II, Part II, Clause A in the SID. Though every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the AMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved. No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme. 8. Risk Profile of the Scheme Mutual Fund Units involve investment risks including the possible loss of principal. Please read the details on risk factors carefully before investment. Scheme specific Risk Factors are summarized below: Scheme Specific Risk Factors: While Small & Mid -cap stocks gives one an opportunity to go beyond the usual large blue chip stocks and present possible higher capital appreciation, it is important to note that Small & Mid-cap stocks can be riskier and more volatile on a relative basis. Therefore, the risk levels of investing in Small & Midcap stocks are more than investing in stocks of large well established companies. It should be noted that over a period of time, Small, Mid and Large cap stocks have demonstrated different levels of volatility and investment returns. And it is important to note that generally, no one class consistently outperforms the others. (i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments \u25cf Equity shares and equity related instrumen ts are volatile and prone to price fluctuations",
    "demonstrated different levels of volatility and investment returns. And it is important to note that generally, no one class consistently outperforms the others. (i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments \u25cf Equity shares and equity related instrumen ts are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks. 6 HDFC Small Cap Fund - KIM \u25cf Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk. \u25cf While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u25cf Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances. (ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities \u2022 The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in i nterest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates. \u2022 Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to th e Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u2022 Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of the issuers. \u2022 Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or defa ult (i.e. the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and",
    "defa ult (i.e. the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Invest ment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis. \u2022 Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. Th e possibility of such prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme. \u2022 Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at wh ich cash flows received from the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed. \u2022 Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment opportunitie s. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent declin e in the value of securities held in the Scheme's portfolio. \u2022 Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price -risk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a 7 HDFC Small Cap Fund - KIM function of the existing coupon, days",
    "-risk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a 7 HDFC Small Cap Fund - KIM function of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price -risk is not unique to Government Securities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are u nique in the sense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by movement in interest rates in the financial system. \u2022 Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated bonds. \u2022 The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio. \u2022 As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these securities are more sensitive to changes in int erest rates and are subject to issuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zer o coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of",
    "when the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived c redit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically. (iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: \u2022 Except for any security of an associate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a stock exchange (\u201cunlisted Securities\u201d) which in general are subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value. \u2022 Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer -specific developments. Such investments display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities. (iv) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated securities The risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to the risk factors associated with debt instruments. \u2022 Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could 8 HDFC Small Cap Fund - KIM be in various forms and could include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter of comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity could be either related or non -related to the issuer like a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypo thecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of the credit enhancement provider, as",
    "in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypo thecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the issuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan pools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer. \u2022 Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit enhancements. Debt securities lack a well -developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold. \u2022 Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, apart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit risk. (v) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri -party Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments. T he members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall",
    "settlement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments. T he members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL). As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's contribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non -defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In addition, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member). CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, o ne with a view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo 9 HDFC Small Cap Fund - KIM trades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its cont ribution to the default fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund. (vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities \u25cf Currency Risk: Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian Rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co -related, can differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to their interest",
    "the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co -related, can differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to their interest rate cycles. \u25cf Credit Risk: Investment in Foreign De bt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with rating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency. \u25cf Taxation Risk: In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI) under section \u201cSpecial Consideration\u201d, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges based on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation. The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its investment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing / evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries wh ere the Scheme invests. All these may entail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk: Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject could differ materially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively. \u25cf Country Risk: The Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi - 10 HDFC Small Cap Fund - KIM lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the",
    "encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi - 10 HDFC Small Cap Fund - KIM lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of trades or otherwise. \u25cf To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time. \u2022 Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities: In case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by regulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in permissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity. (vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives \u25cf The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative p roducts, from time to time, in an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with st ocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices. \u25cf Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies. \u25cf The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. \u25cf Credit Risk: The credit ri sk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and is generally low, as there is",
    "of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. \u25cf Credit Risk: The credit ri sk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. \u25cf Market Risk: Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. \u25cf Illiquidity risk: This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of liquidity in the market. Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate Futures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. (viii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares 11 HDFC Small Cap Fund - KIM \u25cf Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non - cumulative preference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on preference shares in case of inadequate profits in any year. \u25cf Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity. \u25cf Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and unsecured debt in hie rarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is significant risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation. (ix) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending As with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited b",
    "of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited b y the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss of opportunity. (x) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt The Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive. \u25cf Limited Liquidity & Price Risk There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the ability of the investor to resell them. \u25cf Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk The Credit Enhancement stipulated re presents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors' Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and ther eby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess an d sell the Asset. However, many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required to realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may be lower than the amount due from that Obligor. \u25cf Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certifi cates (PTCs). \u25cf Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes",
    "Charge Offs In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certifi cates (PTCs). \u25cf Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could experience losses or delays in the payments. 12 HDFC Small Cap Fund - KIM \u25cf Risk of Co-mingling With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing the same into the Collection account especially considering that some of the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to a potential loss. (xi) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI) Perpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital Regulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory guidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds as per guidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below: Key Risk Factors: - Risk on coupon servicing Banks As per the term s of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow banks to make payment of coupons. NBFCs While NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can also be deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios. Corporates Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI. - Risk of",
    "(instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios. Corporates Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI. - Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks As per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET-1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT -1 bonds can get written down. Further, AT -1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non -viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT -1 Bonds or a public sector cap ital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. 13 HDFC Small Cap Fund - KIM - Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer Banks The issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period from the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not exercise the call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. NBFCs The NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. Corporates There is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call optio n, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date. (xii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling Short-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and returns the stock to close",
    "Risk factors associated with Short Selling Short-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited i f the price increases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio. (xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs: \u25cf Price Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. \u25cf Credit Risk: Credit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of 14 HDFC Small Cap Fund - KIM REITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled. \u25cf Liquidity Risk: This refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for which a liquid m arket exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk. \u25cf Reinvestment Risk: Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be repatriation of funds by th e Trusts in",
    "for which a liquid m arket exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk. \u25cf Reinvestment Risk: Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be repatriation of funds by th e Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay -outs, etc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs an d InvITs comprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations or standards or fut ure amendments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions. (xiv) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities In repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with the seller agreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater than the original sale price, the difference effectively represent ing interest. A repo in corporate debt securities is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporate debt securities as collateral to protect against default. Some of the risks associated with repo in corporate debt are given below: Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy back securities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In case of over the counter (OTC) repo trades, the investment manager will endeavo ur to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with counterparties having strong credit profiles. Also, the counter -party risk is to an extent mitigated by taking collateral equivalent in value to the transaction after knocking off a minimum haircut on the intrinsic value of the collateral. In the event of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate debt securities. In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may also provide settlement guarantee. Collateral Risk : Collateral risk",
    "the intrinsic value of the collateral. In the event of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate debt securities. In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may also provide settlement guarantee. Collateral Risk : Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to meet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for 15 HDFC Small Cap Fund - KIM replacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by considering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The fund manager or the exchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a prespecified period. If the counterparty is not able to top -up either in form of cash / collateral, it would tantamount to early termination of the repo agreement, and the outstanding amount can be recovered by sale of collateral. (xv) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes 1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes. 2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads. (xvi) General Risk factors \u2022 Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units",
    "transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down bec ause of various factors that affect the capital markets in general. \u2022 As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under cer tain circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend Redemption of the units. \u2022 At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest in securities falling within it s investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day -to-day liquidity requirements. \u2022 Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark part icularly over a short to medium term period. \u2022 Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies. \u2022 The Scheme at times m ay receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset - liability mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments. 16 HDFC Small Cap Fund - KIM For details on risk mitigation measures, please refer SID. 9.

However, it is expected that there would be a number of subscriptions and redemptions on a daily basis. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable measure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage and transaction cost. D. HOW WILL THE SCHEME BENCHMARK ITS PERFORMANCE? BSE 250 SmallCap Index (TRI) As required under clause 1.9 of Master Circular, the benchmark has been selected from amongst those notified by AMFI as the first tier benchmark to be adopted by mutual funds and which are reflective of the category of the scheme. The BSE 250 SmallCap is designed to reflect the behaviour and performance of the small capitalised segment of the financial market. The Trustee reserves the right to change the benchmark for evaluation of performance of the Scheme from time to time in conformity with the investment objectives and appropriateness of the benchmark subject to SEBI (MF) Regulations, and other prevailing guidelines, if any.

For details of existing mandatory investments by AMC in various schemes, visit - https://www.hdfcfund.com/statutory-disclosure/mandatory-investment-amc PART III. OTHER DETAILS A. COMPUTATION OF NAV Methodology for Computation of NAV: The Net Asset Value (NAV) per Unit of the Scheme will be computed by dividing the net assets of the Scheme by the number of Units outstanding under the Scheme on the valuation date. The AMC will value its investments according to the valuation norms, as specified in Schedule VIII of the SEBI (MF) Regulations, or such norms as may be specified by SEBI from time to time and as stipulated in the Valuation Policy and Procedures of the Fund, provided in SAI available on website. In case of any conflict between the Principles of Fair Valuation and valuation guidelines specified by SEBI, the Principles of Fair Valuation shall prevail. NAV of Units under each Scheme/ Plan shall be calculated as shown below: NAV (Rs.) = per Unit Market or Fair Value of the Scheme\u2019s Investments + Current Assets - Current Liabilities and Provisions _____________________________________________ 19 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID No. of Units outstanding under the Scheme/Plan The NAV of the Scheme will be calculated and disclosed at the close of every Business Day. Separate NAV will be calculated and announced for each of Plans/Options. The NAVs will be calculated upto 3 decimals. Units will be allotted upto 3 decimals. Illustration for Computation of NAV: NAV for the Scheme shall be calculated as shown below: Particulars Amount (In INR) Assets Investments (at Market Value) 10,000 (Equity/Debt/Derivatives) Current Assets Interest receivable Dividend Receivables Trades Receivables 1,000 550 1,500 Total Assets (A) 13,050 Current Liabilities Trade Payables Expense Payable Dividend payable 1,500 25 25 Total Liabilities (B) 1,550 Net Assets (C) (A \u2013 B) 11,500 Units Outstanding (D) 1,000 NAV per",

(This is the price you need to pay for purchase/ switch-in): The Sale Price for a valid purchase will be the Applicable NAV. i.e. Sale Price = Applicable NAV 20 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID For a valid purchase request of Rs. 10,000 where the applicable NAV is Rs. 11.1234, the units allotted will be: = 10,000 (i.e. purchase amount) 11.1234 (i.e. applicable NAV) = 899.006 units (rounded to three decimals) Charges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above illustration. \u2022 Ongoing Price for redemption (sale)/ switch -outs (to other schemes/plans of the mutual fund) by investors. (This is the price you will receive for redemptions/ switch-outs): The Repurchase Price for a valid repurchase will be the applicable NAV reduced by any exit load (say 1%). i.e. applicable NAV - (applicable NAV X applicable exit load). For a valid repurchase request where the applicable NAV is Rs. 12.1234, the repurchase price will be: = 12.1234 - (12.1234 X 1.00%) = 12.1234 - 0.1212 = Rs. 12.0022 Therefore, for a repurchase of 899.006 units, the proceeds received by the investor will be - = 899.006 (units) * 12.0022 (Repurchase price) = Rs. 10,790.02 (rounded to two decimals) Charges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above illustration. While determining the price of the units, the mutual fund shall ensure that the repurchase price of an open ended scheme is not lower than 97 per cent of the Net Asset Value.

The investor is requested to check the prevailing load structure of the Scheme before investing. 25 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID SECTION II I. INTRODUCTION A. DEFINITIONS / INTERPRETATION Visit: https://www.hdfcfund.com/statutory-disclosure/offer-document-disclosures B. RISK FACTORS \u25a0 Scheme Specific Risk Factors: Some of the specific risk factors related to the Scheme include, but are not limited to the following: Scheme Specific Risk Factors: While Small & Mid-cap stocks gives one an opportunity to go beyond the usual large blue chip stocks and present possible higher capital appreciation, it is important to note that Small & Mid-cap stocks can be riskier and more volatile on a relative basis. Therefore, the risk levels of investing in Small & Midcap stocks are more than investing in stocks of large well establish ed companies. It should be noted that over a period of time, Small, Mid and Large cap stocks have demonstrated different levels of volatility and investment returns. And it is important to note that generally, no one class consistently outperforms the others. (i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments \u2022 Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks. \u2022 Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk. \u2022 While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u2022 Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances. (ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities \u2022 The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV",
    "the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances. (ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities \u2022 The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates. \u2022 Money market instruments, while fair ly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \u2022 Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of the issuers. \u2022 Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions 26 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis. \u2022 Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme. \u2022 Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed. \u2022 Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme",
    "reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed. \u2022 Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in the Scheme's portfolio. \u2022 Government securities where a fixed ret urn is offered run price -risk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government Securities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the sense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influe nced only by movement in interest rates in the financial system. \u2022 Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated bonds. \u2022 The AMC may , considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio. \u2022 As zero coupon securities do not provide",
    "may , considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio. \u2022 As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically. (iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: \u2022 Except for any security of an associate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a stock exchange (\u201cunlisted Securities\u201d) which in general are subject to greater price 27 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID fluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value. \u2022 Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer -specific developments. Such investments display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities. (iv) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated securities The risks factors stated below for the Structured",
    "a deteriorating economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities. (iv) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated securities The risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to the risk factors associated with debt instruments. \u2022 Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and could include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter of comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity could be either related or non -related to the issuer like a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the issuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. I n case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan pools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer. \u2022 Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit enhancements. Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold. \u2022 Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of",
    "adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, apart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit risk. (v) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri -party Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and sett lement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL). As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's contribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non - 28 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In addition, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member). CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another",
    "meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund. (vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities \u25cf Currency Risk: Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian Rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related, can differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to their interest rate cycles. \u25cf Credit Risk: Investment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with rating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency. \u25cf Taxation Risk: In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI) under section \u201c Special Consideration\u201d, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges based on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation. The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its investment portfolio. Furth er, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing / evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All these may entail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus a dversely impacting its NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk: Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it. If",
    "a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus a dversely impacting its NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk: Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject could differ materially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively. \u25cf Country Risk: The Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect 29 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of trades or otherwise. \u25cf To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time. \u2022 Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities: In case the permissible limits for investm ents in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by regulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in permissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity. (vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives \u25cf The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices. \u25cf Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate",
    "a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices. \u25cf Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fun d manager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies. \u25cf The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. \u25cf Credit Risk: The credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. \u25cf Market Risk: Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. \u25cf Illiquidity risk: This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of liquidity in the market. Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate Futures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. (viii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares \u25cf Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non-cumulative preference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on preference shares in case of inadequate profits in any year. 30 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID \u25cf Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity. \u25cf Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower",
    "of inadequate profits in any year. 30 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID \u25cf Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity. \u25cf Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is significant risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation. (ix) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending As with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss of opportunity. (x) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt The Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive. \u25cf Limited Liquidity & Price Risk There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the ability of the investor to resell them. \u25cf Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk The Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors' Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to",
    "Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However, many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required to realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may be lower than the amount due from that Obligor. \u25cf Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs). \u25cf Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could experience losses or delays in the payments. \u25cf Risk of Co-mingling With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing the same into the Collection account especia lly considering that some of the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from 31 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID other funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to a potential loss. (xi) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI) Perpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital Regulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory guidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bond s as per guidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below: Key Risk Factors: - Risk on coupon servicing Banks As per the",
    "corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bond s as per guidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below: Key Risk Factors: - Risk on coupon servicing Banks As per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may no t allow banks to make payment of coupons. NBFCs While NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can also be deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios. Corporates Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI. - Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks As per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET- 1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written down. Further, AT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. - Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer Banks The issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period from the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not exercise the call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments f or a period beyond the first call exercise date. NBFCs The NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. 32 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID However, if the NBFC",
    "a period beyond the first call exercise date. NBFCs The NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. 32 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. Corporates There is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call option, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date. (xii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling Short-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio. (xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs: \u25cf Price Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estat e and Infrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures. \u25cf Interest Rate Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. \u25cf Credit Risk: Credit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instr uments of REITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled. \u25cf Liquidity Risk: This refers to the",
    "a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instr uments of REITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled. \u25cf Liquidity Risk: This refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for which a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk. \u25cf Reinvestment Risk: Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay -outs, etc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns. \u25cf Legal and Regulatory Risk The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will 33 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions. (xiv) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities In repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with the seller agreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater than the original sale price, the difference effectively representing interest. A repo in corporate debt securities is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporate debt securities as collateral to protect against default. Some of the risks associated with repo in corporate debt are given below: Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy back securities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In",
    "corporate debt securities as collateral to protect against default. Some of the risks associated with repo in corporate debt are given below: Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy back securities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In case of over the counter (OTC) repo trades, the investment manager will endeavour to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with counterparties having strong credit profiles. Also, the counter-party risk is to an extent mitigated by taking collateral equivalent in value to the transaction after knocking off a minimum haircut on the intrinsic value of the collateral. In the event of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate debt securities. In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may also provide settlement guarantee. Collateral Risk: Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to meet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an earl y termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for replacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security than req uired as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by co nsidering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The fund manager or the exchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a prespecified period. If the counterparty is not able to top-up either in form of cash / collateral, it would tantamount to early termination of the repo agreement, and the outstanding amount can be recovered by sale of collateral. (xv) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes 1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any change in the investment",
    "would tantamount to early termination of the repo agreement, and the outstanding amount can be recovered by sale of collateral. (xv) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes 1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes. 2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads. (xvi) General Risk factors \u2022 Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down because of various factors that affect the capital markets in general. 34 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID \u2022 As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under certain circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend Redemption of the units. \u2022 At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest in securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity requirements. \u2022 Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to medium term period. \u2022 Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies. \u2022 The",
    "risk of significant variance between the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to medium term period. \u2022 Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies. \u2022 The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset -liability mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments. C. RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES Risk Mitigation measures for investments in equity / equity related and debt instruments \u2022 The Scheme\u2019s portfolio shall comprise mainly of stocks of Small-Cap companies (at least 65% of the portfolio shall be in Small-Cap stocks and balance in Mid-Cap or large cap stocks). This flexibility of investing in large-cap stocks shall aid in managing volatility and also aid reasonable liquidity. \u2022 Within its investment universe, the Scheme aims to maintain a well -diversified equity portfolio comprising stocks across various sectors of the economy. This shall aid in managing concentration risk and sector specific risks. \u2022 Any investments in debt securities would be undertaken after assessing the associated credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Credit Evaluation Policy The credit evaluation policy of the AMC entails evaluation of credit fundamentals of each investment opportunity. Some of the factors that are evaluated inter -alia may include outlook on the sector, parentage, quality of management, and overa ll financial strength of the credit. The AMC utilises ratings of recognized rating agencies as an input in the credit evaluation process. Investments in bonds and debenture are usually in instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by a recognized rating agency. In line with clause 12.12 of Master Circular, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals for investments in unrated instruments. The AMC Board and the Trustee shall approve the detailed parameters for such investments. The details of such investments would be communicated by the AMC to the Trustee in their periodical reports. It would also be clearly mentioned in the reports, how the parameters have been complied with. However, in case any security does not fall under the parameters, the prior approval of Board of AMC and Trustee shall be sought. Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk of not",
    "periodical reports. It would also be clearly mentioned in the reports, how the parameters have been complied with. However, in case any security does not fall under the parameters, the prior approval of Board of AMC and Trustee shall be sought. Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to sell / liquidate a security at short notice at prevailing market prices or without incurring impact cost. While government bonds, money market instruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easier to sell, corporate bonds and other instruments typically face higher liquidity risk. Further, higher rated securities normally are more liquid 35 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID compared to lower rated securities. As a result, different portfolios will face different levels of liquidity risk based on the underlying portfolio composition. Some of the strategies to reduce liquidity risk are creating portfolios that are diversified across matu rities, ratings, types of securities, etc. in line with the fund objectives, regulations and investment strategy. Credit Risk: Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence, credit risk faced by different schemes will be different based on the underlying portfolio / investment strategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Each of the scheme/portfolio will endeavour to maintain adequate diversification across issuers / sectors in line with scheme objectives, regulations and investment strategy. Unrated investments, if any, would require specific approval from a committee constituted for the purpose. Debt Derivatives Risk: The AMC has pro vision for using derivative instruments for portfolio balancing and hedging purposes. Interest Rate Swaps will be done with approved counter parties under pre approved ISDA agreements. Mark to Market of swaps, netting off of cash flow and default provision clauses will be provided as per standard practice on a reciprocal basis. Interest Rate Swaps and other derivative instruments will be used as per local (RBI and SEBI) regulatory guidelines. Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk of change in the NAVs due to change in overall market yields. The change in value of a security, for a given change in yield, is higher for a security with higher duration and vice versa. Hence portfolios with higher duration will have higher volatility. The AMC shall strive",
    "risk of change in the NAVs due to change in overall market yields. The change in value of a security, for a given change in yield, is higher for a security with higher duration and vice versa. Hence portfolios with higher duration will have higher volatility. The AMC shall strive to actively manage the duration of the respective funds based on the prevailing market conditions / outlook of interest rates, keeping in mind the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable regulations. Concentration Risk: The AMC will attempt to mitigate this risk by maintaining adequate diversification across issuers/ sectors / instrument type in line with the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable regulations. This will also be managed by keeping prudent investment limits on any particular industry or issuer or issuer group based on the size, credit profile, etc. to reduce issuer or industry specific risk. Risk Mitigation measures for investments in Non-Convertible Preference Shares: Credit Risk - To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in -depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Liquidity Risk - The Fund endeavours to invest in preference shares of those companies which have relatively better market acceptability amongst market participants that increases the probability of secondary sale in case an exit from the investment is required. Unsecured in nature - The Fund endeavours to mitigate this risk by exercising due diligence while assessing the business, financial and management risks of the company before investing. Risk Mitigation factors relating to investment in Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI): \u2022 Risk on coupon servicing and Risk of write-down or conversion into equity Banks: The risks on coupon servicing or principal write down/ conversion to equity are mitigated, to a certain extent, if the investee bank has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory guidelines. Hence, an in -depth credit evaluation of each ba nk is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable 36 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed.

    "focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable 36 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed. Investment is done only in the AT -1 bonds of banks with strong credit worthiness, in our assessment. This, in turn, reduces the risk of its capital position falling below regulatory requirements and / or reaching PONV. Risk of write-down or conversion into equity is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. \u2022 Risk on coupon servicing NBFCs These risks are mitigated, to certain extent, if the investee NBFC has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory guidelines. Hence, an in-depth credit evaluation of each NBFC is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed. Corporates To mitigate this risk, an in -depth credit evaluation of each corporate is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, industry position, market share e tc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Additionally, given that the coupon is usually cumulative in nature and the corporate is restricted from paying any dividends till all previous dues are paid to the perpetual bond investor, the company has adequate incentive to not defer coupon on PDIs. \u2022 Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer Banks While the issuer bank does have an option to not exercise the first call, experience suggests that all Indian banks till now have exercised the call option during the call period. We believe that banks are cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to risk of not exercising the call option at the first call date. Further, as we invest in issuers with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to understand the importance of exercising the call as the part of their long term capital raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of call option exercise can lead to increase in cost of AT1 bonds for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond tenors) and impact the bank's profitability adversely. Given the importance of AT1 instruments for prudently managing the capital levels and improving the returns",
    "instance of skipping of call option exercise can lead to increase in cost of AT1 bonds for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond tenors) and impact the bank's profitability adversely. Given the importance of AT1 instruments for prudently managing the capital levels and improving the returns for the equity holders, we are of the opinion that banks would choose to service the interest on AT1 bonds and exercise the first call option on AT1 bonds, as they have done in the past. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual instrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the annual call on these instruments would enable the bank to call the bond on any of the subsequent annual call options dates. NBFCs and Corporates While the issuer is not obligated to exercise the call option on first call date, the coupon step -up usually provides financial incentive to the Issuer to exercise the call option. Further, as we invest in issuer with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to be cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to exercising the call as the part of their long term resource raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of first call option exercise can lead to increase in cost of PDI for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond tenors) and impact the issuer's profitability adversely. Finally, in case th e issuer is unable to call the perpetual instrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the coupon step up also compensates the investor for extended holding period. While these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would be completely eliminated. II.

Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs), the proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling",
    "finance company, housing finance company, or a manufacturing/service company) to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), typically set up in the form of a trust. Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs), the proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling his loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much before the maturity of the underlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from borrowers. Typically, the transaction is provided with a limited amount of credit enhancement (as stipulated by the rating agency for a target rating), which provides protection to investors against defaults by the underlying borrowers. Generally available asset classes for securitisation in India are: 40 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID \u25cf Commercial vehicles \u25cf Auto and two wheeler pools \u25cf Mortgage pools (residential housing loans) \u25cf Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans \u25cf Corporate loans/receivables Investment / Risk Mitigation Strategy 1. Risk profile of securitised debt vis-\u00e0-vis risk appetite of the Scheme The risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities at the same level of credit rating. Se curitised debt offers additional income (spread) over a debt security of similar rating and maturity, which enables the scheme to optimize its income without taking any additional credit risk. Securitised debt is generally less liquid, however, investment in securitised debt is made to maintain a diversified portfolio of debt securities that optimizes return without increasing the overall risk profile of the Scheme. 2. Policy relating to originators based on nature of originator, track record, NPAs, losses in earlier securitised debt, etc The originator is an entity (like banks, non-banking finance companies, corporates etc), which has initially provided the loan & is also generally responsible for servicing the loans. The schemes will invest in securitised debt of originators with at least investment grade credit rating and established track record. A detailed evaluation of originator is done before the investment is made in securitised debt of any originator on various parameters given below: \u25cf Track record The investment in securitised debt is done based on origination and underwriting process and capabilities of the originator, overview of corporate structure, group to which they belong, experience of the company in the business & how long they have been in the business, financial condition of the company, credit",
    "record The investment in securitised debt is done based on origination and underwriting process and capabilities of the originator, overview of corporate structure, group to which they belong, experience of the company in the business & how long they have been in the business, financial condition of the company, credit rating, past performance of similar pools by the originator, etc. \u25cf Willingness to pay through credit enhancement facilities etc. Credit enhancement is provided by the originator, as indicated by rating agencies, so as to adequately cover the defaults and acts as a risk mitigation measure. The size of the credit enhancement as indicated by rating agency depends on the originator's track record, past delinquencies, pattern of the portfolio & characteristics of the pool vis-a-vis of the portfolio, nature of the asset class. \u25cf Ability to pay The quality of the origination impacts the performance of the underlying asset & thus originators with strong systems and processes in place can eliminate poor quality assets. A robust risk management system of the originator and availability of MIS reports on timely basis, results in creation of strong asset portfolio. \u25cf Business Risk Assessment The business risk assessment of originator / underlying borrower also includes detailed credit assessment wherein following factors are also considered: - Outlook for the economy (domestic and global) - Outlook for the industry - Company specific factors In addition, a detailed review and assessment of rating rationale is done along with interactions with the company as well as the rating agency. All investment in securitised debt is done after taking into account, the Critical Evaluation Parameters (for pool loan and single loan securitisation transactions) regarding the originator / underlying issuer as mentioned below: \u25cf Default track record/ frequent alteration of redemption conditions / covenants 41 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID \u25cf High leverage ratios of the ultimate borrower (for single -sell downs) - both on a standalone basis as well on a consolidated level/ group level \u25cf Higher proportion of reschedulement of underlying assets of the pool or loan, as the case may be \u25cf Higher proportion of overdue assets of the pool or the underlying loan, as the case may be \u25cf Poor reputation in market \u25cf Insufficient track record of servicing of the pool or the loan, as the case may be. 3. Risk mitigation strategies for investments with each kind of originator Investments are based on assessment of",
    "the pool or the underlying loan, as the case may be \u25cf Poor reputation in market \u25cf Insufficient track record of servicing of the pool or the loan, as the case may be. 3. Risk mitigation strategies for investments with each kind of originator Investments are based on assessment of following parameters, so as to mitigate risk associated with such investment: a. Credit quality, size and reach of the originator b. Nature of receivables/asset category i.e. cars, construction equipment, commercial vehicles, personal loans etc. c. Collection process, infrastructure and follow-up mechanism d. Quality of MIS e. Credit cum liquidity enhancement f. Credit appraisal norms of originator g. Asset Quality - portfolio delinquency levels h. Past performance of rated pools i. Pool Characteristics - seasoning, Loan-to-value ratios, geographic diversity etc. 4. The level of diversification with respect to the underlying assets, and risk mitigation measures for less diversified investments Diversification of underlying assets is achieved through a) prudent mix of asset categories - i.e. cars (new, used), commercial vehicles, construction equipment, unsecured loans to individuals or small & medium enterprises b) total number of contracts in a pool c) average ticket size of loans and d) geographical distribution. Risk mitigation measures for less d iversified investments in pools is accomplished through the size of credit enhancement, seasoning or loan to value ratios.

In case of securitised debt with underlying being single loan, the investment limit applicable to the underlying borrower is considered. B. Other investment will be decided on a case to case basis. In case of asset backed pools (ABS), evaluation of the pool assets is done considering the following factors: (Refer the table above which illustrates the averages of parameters considered while selecting the pool) \u2022 Size of the loan \u2022 Average original maturity of the pool \u2022 Loan to Value Ratio \u2022 Average seasoning of the pool \u2022 Default rate distribution \u2022 Geographical Distribution \u2022 Credit enhancement facility \u2022 Liquid facility \u2022 Structure of the pool 5. Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation The illustrative average seasoning of the debt by originator prior to securitisation is given above in table (Refer Point 4). Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation in the case of asset pools is in the form of seasoning of loans to various asset classes (cars, commercial vehicles, etc.) and generally varies from one month to six months depending on the nature of asset. 6. Minimum retention percentage by originator of debts to be securitised While minimum retention percentage by originator is not prescribed, any amount retained by the originator through subordination is viewed positively at the time of making investment and generally varies from 5% to 10%. 7. The mechanism to tackle conflict of interest when the mutual fund invests in securitised debt of an originator and the originator in turn makes investments in that particular scheme of the fund All proposals for investment in securitised debt are evaluated by the credit analyst based on several parameters such as nature of underlying asset category, pool characteristics, asset quality, credit rating of the securitisation transaction, and credit cum liquidity enhancement available. Investment in securitised debt in any scheme is made by the respective fund manager in line with the investment objective of that scheme. 43 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID 8.

The resources and mechanism of individual risk assessment with the AMC for monitoring investment in securitised debt (in general) Investment in securitised debt is monitored regularly with regards to its performance on various parameters such as collection efficiency, delinquencies, prepayments and utilization of credit enhancement. Information on these parameters is available through monthly reports from Pool Trustees and through information disseminated by the rating agencies. Monthly performance report is released by the credit analyst to the fund management team and the fund management team periodically reviews the same. Trading in Derivatives \u2022 The Scheme may take derivatives position based on the opportunities available subject to the guidelines provided by SEBI from time to time and in line with the overall investment objective of the Scheme. \u2022 The Scheme intends to use derivatives mainly for the purpose of hedging and portfolio balancing. Losses may arise as a result of using derivatives, but these are likely to be compensated by the gains on the underlying cash instruments held by the Scheme. \u2022 The Scheme may take position in derivative instruments like Futures, Options, and such other derivative instruments as may be permitted by SEBI from time to time. Exposure to Derivatives The exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by SEBI vide its clause 12.25 of Master Circular and as amended from time to time are as follows: Position Limits The position limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by clause 12.25 of the Master Circular read with SEBI circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-2/P/CIR/2024/140 dated October 15, 2024 and SEBI circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD-1/P/CIR/2025/79 dated May 29, 2025 are as follows: i. Position limit for Mutual Funds in index options contracts a) The Mutual Fund position limit in all index options contracts at PAN level shall be as follows: i. Net end of day FutEq OI limit for options to be \u20b91,500 cr. and ii. Gross end of day FutEq OI to be \u20b910,000 cr. (i.e. neither gross long FutEq OI nor gross short FutEq OI shall exceed \u20b910,000 cr.) This limit would be applicable on open positions in all options contracts on a particular Underlying Index. ii. Position limit for Mutual Funds in index futures contracts a) The Mutual Fund position limit in all index futures contracts on a particular Underlying Index shall be higher of 15%",
    "\u20b910,000 cr.) This limit would be applicable on open positions in all options contracts on a particular Underlying Index. ii. Position limit for Mutual Funds in index futures contracts a) The Mutual Fund position limit in all index futures contracts on a particular Underlying Index shall be higher of 15% of futures OI for that index or \u20b9500 cr. b) This limit would be applicable on open positions in all futures contracts on a particular Underlying Index. c) The above stated position limits for index futures would be measured on gross notional basis. The position limits shall be computed on a gross basis at the level of MF and on a net basis at the level of schemes of MF. Formulation of Open Interest (OI) i. OI in derivatives shall be measured at portfolio level by computing the net Delta adjusted open positions across futures and options for an underlying at a given point in time. Delta denotes sensitivity of price movement of derivative position with respect to that of the underlying. Accordingly, long futures have a delta of +1 times notional. For options, delta will range between 44 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID 0 and +1 times notional for long calls and between 0 and \u20131 times notional for long puts. In case of short options position, effective delta for short calls is negative and that of short put is positive. ii. Gross addition of such net Future Equivalent Open Interest (FutEq OI) across all the Unique Client Codes would form the FutEq OI for the Stock/Index derivatives. iii. Additional position limit for hedging In addition to the position limits at point (i) and (ii) above, Mutual Funds may take exposure in equity index derivatives subject to the following limits: 1. Aggregate short positions in index derivatives (short futures, short calls and long puts) shall not exceed (FutEq terms for Index options and gross notional terms for Index futures) the Mutual Fund\u2019s holding of stocks. 2. Aggregate long positions in index derivatives (long futures, long calls and short puts) shall not exceed (FutEq ter ms for Index options and gross notional terms for Index futures) the Mutual Fund\u2019s holding of cash and cash equivalent, government securities, T -Bills and similar instruments. iv.

Position limit for Mutual Funds for stock based derivative contracts The Mutual Fund position limit in a derivative contract on a particular underlying stock, i.e. stock option contracts and stock futures contracts will be as follows: The combined futures and options position limit shall be 30% of the applicable Market Wide Position Limit (MWPL). v. Position limit for each Scheme of a Mutual Fund The Scheme-wise position limit requirements shall be: 1. The gross open positions across all derivative contracts on a particular underlying s tock should not exceed the higher of: 1% of the free float market capitalization (in terms of number of shares). or 5% of the open interest in the derivative contracts on a particular underlying stock (in terms of number of contracts). 2. These position limits would be applicable on the combined position in all derivative contracts on an underlying stock at a Stock exchange. 3. For index based contracts, Mutual Funds shall disclose the total open interest held by its Scheme or all Schemes put together in a particular Underlying Index, if such open interest equals to or exceeds 15% of the open interest of all derivative contracts on that Underlying Index. Exposure Limits The exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by clauses 12.24 and 12.25 of Master Circular, are as follows: 1. The cumulative gross exposure through equity, debt, derivative positions (including fixed income derivatives), repo transactions in corporate debt securities, credit default swaps, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), other permitted securities/assets and such other securities/assets as may be permitted by SEBI from time to time shall not exceed 100% of the net assets of the scheme. Security wise hedge positions using derivatives such as Interest Rate Swaps, call options written under the covered call Strategy and any other positions specifically exempted under SEBI guidelines from time to time, will not be considered in calculating above exposure. 45 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID 2. Mutual Funds shall not write options or purchase instruments with em -bedded written options (except for exposure on account of call option written under the covered call strategy, if permitted under the Scheme). 3.

The total exposure related to option premium paid must n ot exceed 20% of the net assets of the scheme. 4. Cash or cash equivalents i.e. Government Securities, T-Bills and Repo on Government Securities having residual maturity of less than 91 days may be treated as not creating any exposure. 5. Exposure due to hedging positions may not be included in the above mentioned limits subject to the following: a) Hedging positions are the derivative positions that reduce possible losses on an existing position in securities and till the existing position remains. b) Hedging positions cannot be taken for existing derivative positions. Exposure due to such positions shall have to be added and treated under limits mentioned in Point 1. c) Any derivative instrument used to hedge has the same underlying security as the exist ing position being hedged. d) The quantity of underlying associated with the derivative position taken for hedging purposes does not exceed the quantity of the existing position against which hedge has been taken. 6.

    "which the hedging position has been taken, shall be treated under the limits mentioned in point 1. 8. Definition of Exposure in case of Derivative Positions Each position taken in derivatives shall have an associated exposure as defined under. Exposure is the maximum possible loss that may occur on a position. However, certain derivative positions may theoretically have unlimited possible loss. Exposure in derivative positions shall be computed as follows: Position Exposure Long Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts Short Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts Option Bought Option Premium Paid * Lot Size * Number of Contracts 46 HDFC Small Cap Fund-SID Exposure limits on Credit Default Swaps (CDS) Exposure through CDS (Notional amount of both CDS bought and sold) shall not exceed 10% of AUM of scheme and shall be within the overall limit of derivatives. Exposure limits on Interest Rate Futures (IRF) The exposure limits for trading in Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) by Mutual Funds specified by clause 12.25.9 of Master Circular are as follows: i. To reduce interest rate risk in a debt portfolio, mutual funds may hedge the portfolio or part of the portfolio (including one or more securities) on weighted average modified duration basis by using Interest Rate Futures (IRFs). The maximum extent of short position that may be taken in IRFs to hedge interest rate risk of the portfolio or part of the portfolio, is as per the formula given below: (Portfolio Modified Duration* Market Value of the Portfolio) (Futures Modified Duration *Futures Price/PAR) ii. In case the IRF used for hedging the interest rate risk has different underlying security(s) than the existing position being hedged, it would result in imperfect hedging. iii. Imperfect hedging using IRFs may be considered to be exempted from the gross exposure, upto maximum of 20% of the net assets of the scheme, subject to the following: a) Exposure to IRFs is created only for hedging the interest rate risk based on the weighted average modified duration of the bond portfolio or part of the portfolio. b) Mutual Funds are permitted to resort to imperfect hedging, without it being considered under the gross exposure limits, if and only if, the correlation between the portfolio or part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged portions, if any) and the IRF is atleast 0.9 at the time of initiation of hedge.

In case of any subsequent deviation from the correlation c riteria, the same may be rebalanced within 5 working days and if not rebalanced within the timeline, the derivative positions created for hedging shall be considered under the gross exposure computed in terms of clause 12.24.1 of Master Circular. The correlation should be calculated for a period of last 90 days. Explanation: If the fund manager intends to do imperfect hedging upto 15% of the portfolio using IRFs on weighted average modified duration basis, either of the following conditions need to be complied with: i. The correlation for past 90 days between the portfolio and the IRF is at least 0.9 or ii.
